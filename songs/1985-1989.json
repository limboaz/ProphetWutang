Yeah\nHere we go\n\n[Verse]\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nWhen people wore pajamas and lived life slow\nWhen laws were stern and justice stood\nAnd people were behavin' like they ought ta: good\nThere lived a little boy who was misled\nBy another little boy and this is what he said:\n\"Me and you, Ty, we're gonna make some cash\nRobbin' old folks and makin' the dash\"\nThey did the job, money came with ease\nBut one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease\nHe robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha\nTried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover\nThe cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic\nHe said \"Keep still, boy, no need for static\"\nPunched him in his belly and he gave him a slap\nBut little did he know the little boy was strapped\nThe kid pulled out a gun, he said \"Why'd you hit me?\"\nThe barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney\nThe cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure\n\"I'll do years if I pull this trigga\"\nSo he cold dashed and ran around the block\nCop radios in to another lady cop\nHe ran by a tree, there he saw this sista\nShot for the head, he shot back but he missed her\nLooked 'round good and from expectations\nSo he decided he'd head for the subway stations\nBut she was coming and he made a left\nHe was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath\nKnocked an old man down and swore he killed him\nThen he made his move to an abandoned building\nRan up the stairs up to the top floor\nOpened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?)\nDave, the dope fiend shootin' dope\nWho don't know the meaning of water nor soap\nHe said \"I need bullets, hurry up, run!\"\nThe dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun\nHe went outside but there was cops all over\nThen he dipped into a car \u2012 a stolen Nova\nRaced up the block doing 83\nCrashed into a tree near university\nEscaped alive though the car was battered\nRat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered\nRan out of bullets and he still had static\nGrabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic\nPointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead\nHe told the cops \"Back off or honey here's dead\"\nDeep in his heart he knew he was wrong\nSo he let the lady go and he starts to run on\nSirens sounded, he seemed astounded\nAnd before long the little boy got surrounded\nHe dropped his gun, so went the glory\nAnd this is the way I have to end this story\nHe was only seventeen, in a madman's dream\nThe cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream\nThis ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh\nJust another case about the wrong path\nStraight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast\nGood night\n\n[Outro]\n(Knock him out the box, Rick\nKnock him out, Rick)\n- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird\n- I know right what does he mean\n\u201cStraight and narrow or yo\u2019 soul gets cast\"?\n- I don\u2019t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something\n- Well, good night\n- Good night\n\nAnother (that's right!)

Wait\" His dick went weak\nIt said \"Dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak\"\nHe gathered his things he wanted to leave this place\nBut first he wanted to see the vagina face to face\nHe opened it up, with his bare two thumbs\nHe seen crabs with spears and Indian drums!\n\nThey's going:\nHeya hiya heya hey, hey\nHeya hiya heya hey\nHeya hey, heya hey\nHeya hiya heya hey\nHeya hiya heya hey\n\n"

Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth\nI was so in shock, my heart went down south\nSo please, listen to the message that I send\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...\n\n"

Who would ever marry you?\nYou're looking for a man that will carry you\nAnd buy you nice things, like diamond rings\nYou're amazed at the truth that my rhyming brings\nBut the truth is the only way you'll ever see\nThat the life that you're hoping for will never be\nBut the race isn't over, put down the rope\nShant\u00e9 is here to say there's still hope\n\n[Hook]\nSo lend me your ears, dry up your tears\nAnd let's hear the cheers for the years\nOf the independent woman\n\n[Interlude]\n(Yeah)\n(Louder)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo much to live for, she wants to die\nLife's full of pitfalls, maybe that's why\nHer pops went to jail, her mother tapped her vein\nCity took custody and trapped her in pain\nFeeling so alone in the room with a stranger\nHates her own blood and nothing's gonna change her\nAngry at the world cause it doesn't play fair\nSo much despair does she feel, no one to care\nNot a single family member will remember her\nSmoke's in her eyes, and the past is a blur\nShe's on her own now, living with some other girls\nWith the same damn lives, but from a different world\nThese girls are lost, how the city is full of fools\nSo many years, no guidings, and no kinda rules\nNo love to give, yo, they need love to live\nIf not instead, they'll ponder in a bed\nSex is the thing that makes her feel wanted\nLove and care, for she's undaunted\nBecause whoever is laying there won't really matter\nSuch a sad song when young dreams shatter\nI really don't think glue is gonna fix it\nBut homegirl can walk the right path if she picks it\n\n[Hook]\nSo lend me your ears, dry up your tears\nAnd let's hear the cheers for the years\nOf the independent woman\n\n[Interlude]\n(Yeah)\n(Louder)\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe black woman role grows larger each day\nNothing in the way so what we teach may\nSomehow help those young sisters that doze\nAnd sleepwalk through life with their eyes closed\nYou don't need a man, all you need is to know you can\nThen you can stand on your own two feet and\nAchieve anything that you want out of life\nDo for yourself, then you can be a wife\nAnd you'll feel so good that you wanna shout\nBecause you got to the top and got there without\nRelying on Tom, Dick, or Billy Dee\nYou don't have to turn the lights on to really see\n\n[Hook]\nSo lend me your ears, dry up your tears\nAnd let's hear the cheers for the years\nOf the independent woman\n\n"

They know who it is\nSpell it out at full, keep their heads down low\nGive me a mic and history is made at my show\nI'm on point, I'm like a knife when it's sharp and new\nGo 'head and beef, chief, and I'll cut right through\nNow put your tongue back in your mouth, stop breathin so loud\nThis is my mic, my rhyme, my beat and my crowd\nYou want a piece of it, you think you got what it takes?\nI mean line for line without a word bein fake\nEvery rhyme able to flex, plex and vex\nNow stop and think: Is she right? You know I'm correct\nBecause I diss hard and I don't miss\nBut even if I did, I just hit em with this\n\n"

Don't mean to harness the charm\nDom Perrignon in the arm, duck alert the alarm\nI'm not braggin or boastin, don't wanna be rude\nBut sad sorry-looking Sallys keep tellin' I got an attitude\n\nYou wanna know why I play you like that? I don't like your face\nTake your running shoes off, you ain't in this race\nKick back, sit back, step off, sit down and be numb\nFeed crumbs to bums, rock rhymes over drums\nIt ain't complicated, must I break it down?\nDef rhymes from a lady with a real live sound\nMust admit it I'm with it so get with it, you dig?\nFlossin carat and gear, and real hair, not a wig\nBodily I'm vivacious and vocally gracious\nAntoinette's put together in all the right places\nFit to carry wit, makin hit after hit\nNever ask me to quit cause I'm eternally lit\nYou ain't ready, baby, sorry Sally, this is my thing\nA lot of male vocalists can't even hang\nAnd if they sound like a sissy when they diss they just piss me\nOff, I get wild and on the mic I get busy\nBold just like a bee, I'm the queen of this thing\nRock a beat inside out like Whitney can sing\nClear my throat, hit a note, ( ? ) and bruised\nYou run circles with my words, I finds and loose\nYa, run your ( ? ) to the edge, you must be on qualudes\nDon't be comin in my face ( ? ) sayin I got an attitude\n\n"

I know it ain't Halloween\nThe cross in the background burnin' made a ill scene\nFirst I was panicky, then I was angry\nOne creep even had a rope ready to hang me\nNow who am I supposed to be? Eddie Spaghetti?\nYou come and vic Rob G any time you're ready?\nFuck that, they had me trapped so I rushed back\nThey tried to bust me but they don't have enough caps\nI dipped, dived, slipped, slid, they missed me\nI had to move quick or they was bound to get me\nOne bullet grazed me, that didn't phase me\nWhat could I say? I was havin' a fucked up day\nStood up and took aim, my finger on the trigger\nI shouted \"Now let me hear you say nigga!\"\nWell anyway, nobody spoke or went for broke\nThe place was all clouded up from gunsmoke\nAnd everything got quiet, I don't buy it\nJust a second ago we had a riot\nThey must be plannin' attack or settin' a trap\nWhatever the case you won't get this black\nNow I'm on the edge and there's no denyin' it\nWhatever the hell might work I'm tryin' it\nThought I was a target that they could get right quick\nBut I ain't goin' out like no statistic\nAnother number, made me wonder\nHow many other brothers they've put under\nI sat in the dark real still for a long time\nDidn't make a sound cos I've got a strong mind\nMade my way to the street, it was daybreak\nMust've fallen asleep, but for Pete's sake\nI didn't see the enemy tryin' to put an end to me\nThe night before, my finger trigger was sore\nI went in the house to get a fresh clip\nAnd then I woke up an' shit...\n\n(It's a bad dream, man. That's all, man, you know what I'm sayin'?\nGuess I was just buggin' or somethin', man...)\n\n"

What would I gain? Nothin'\nSo when I speak, yo, I don't be bluffin'\nI be puffin' on high-powered cess blunts\nI don't try to front\nOr back away from a challenge, I'm game\nYou suckers rhymin' sound like your lips are lame\nYou seem to need therapy for you speech impediment\nTake this advice because it's for your own benefit\nI'm energetic, magnetic, and athletic\nOne more thing, and it's called poetic\nMy style is unorthodox, but of course it rocks\nAnd when it comes to styles I'm over-stocked\nYou might never get to hear my last rhyme\n'Cause I been writin since you heard me last time\nI could go on,t he G is strong\nI rock the show, I clock the dough\nAnd let the words flow\n\n"

You must need a boost\nFrom the bass, not the pipe type\nThat's too damn hype for me\nWhat I like to see\nIs people gettin busy\nTill they're damn near dizzy\nTurn it, churn it, twist it, lift it and shake it\nYou know what?

I'm chillin Duke\n[Red] Yo do me a favor man -- pleeeeeease tell me\nAbout these big ol bubblehead girls out here\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nWell hey, you know that lady on the top floor of my buildin?\nThe heavyset one with about ten children?\nYou may remember her as a slim honey\nWhen her man name was Pimp Daddy Hustler Stack Money\nA big time drug dealer from around the way\nSlingin rocks, makin G's everyday\nHe drove a big fat Mercedes Benz\nAnd even bought her a car to perpetrate for her friends\nIt was a brand new Jag, with the spoiler and rag\nAnd the girl was a nag, cause all she did was just brag\nI mean baaaaaaaaaaad -- we know your coat cost a lot\nYou didn't have to leave on the price tag\nAnd count the times her stomach got plump\nHavin baby after baby by the same old chump\nAnd then the day came, he left the dame shamed\nBut who's to blame? Y'all know the name of the game\nPimp Daddy's wanted as he maxes and relaxes\nShe can't even sue for money, pushers don't pay taxes\nSo what's to do? Oh yeah\nTo feed ten mouths, she had to call on Mr. Welfare\n\n[Red] What? Mr. Welfare?\nMan they playin high-post with low income\nCheck this out -- when y'all go around to the corner\nY'all gonna check out another episode\nGo like somethin like this..\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nHey, if you think that suck, bust this\nAnother little story as I reminisce\nAbout an old friend of mine that was livin out of order\nMakin money like water (illlllll-egal?) Yeah, sorta\nHe sold drugs and robbed a lot of people\nBut in these days and times, who lives illegal?\nIt's all about who knows the trade\nAnd who am I to knock him? Homeboy was gettin paid\nHe chose his own lifestyle to live - it was negative\nBut his own prerogative\nMakin cash to flash and stash in half the trash\nThe cops made the dash (sufferin succotash!)\nBecause he had to do ten in the pen\nAnd then begin again to apprehend, huh\nBut what's lost is lost, the reign is over\n(Huhhh, see ya!) Nice to know ya\nMoney, no longer can he collect it\nCan't even get a job cause he got a jail record\nSo what's left? No hopes of a career\nSo yeahhh, he's callin Mr. Welfare!\n\n[Red] Mr. Big Daddy Kane\nThey don't know what time it is about Mr. Welfare\nDo me a favor -- open up your book to page fifteen\nAt the top and read it off like thisssssssss\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nHere's a story of a guy who had to cop out his life\nFor bein a high school dropout\nIn the ninth grade he wanted to get paid\nBut now the young brother needs government aid\nBecause in his past he decided to cut class\nAnd run in the streets to make ends meet\nNo shame in the game of his\nBut silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!\nSo when you sat on the corner with a 40 ounce\nTalkin bout whattup? Can't even pronounce\nYour words correct, now in retrospect\nThat's a shame - but in '89, who gives a heck?\nThere's no type of path to follow\nIt's all about a dollar, fuck bein a scholar\nThat's why your report card's through\nLike a BizMark beat, it reads eww-eww-eww-eww-eww!\nSo now you wanna wake up and smell the coffee?\nLookin for a helpin hand, but get off me!\nI tried to tell you the deal last summer\nStay in school, and get yourself a diploma\nNow you're on your own, tryin to make it alone\nNo food or home, chewin on a meaty bone\nSo what's to do since the cupboard is bare?\nBrrring brrring! Call on Mr. Welfare\n\n[Red] Yo Kane, that's the story about my man Mr. Welfare huh?\n[Kane] Yo like Chuck D said, how low can you go\n[Red] If she go any lower, she gonna have a personal problem\nYo my man Mister Cee, cut it up money!\n\n* Mister Cee cuts \"welll-fare\" *\n\n[Kool DJ Red Alert]\nWe-eh-el-el-el, el-el-elllllllfare, c'mon!\nYeah Mr. Welfare\nHe on some new stuff, what what is it?\nHe all new and improved?\nRight? Yeah, like that old Bug-Out stuff\nThis guy, is he alright or what?\nI think he on a mission with no kind of learnin\nYou know what Big Daddy Kane?\nWe gonna have to take care of this matter\nMister Cee, go ahead, cut it up\nMy man Big Daddy Kane gonna see about my man Mr. Welfare alright?\nPlaces to go, people to see, things to do\nAnd you know what else to get.. see ya!\nYeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhsss!\n\n"

Heheh, I'll say\nI'm so cool and yet so hyped\nWhen I'm on the mic it's something like\nHiroshima, remember Pearl Harbor\nFeel the fire but don't bother\nTo run for cover you don't escape\nOn record compact disc or tape\nOnce you play it the fuse is lit\nAn explosion, you getting hit\nWith rhythmic prophecies, visions I foresee\nMe blowing up in your face now stop to see\nSmoke fumes in the shape of a mushroom\nCloud the room because I went boom\nI'll light the sky like a comet\nWhen it comes to rap, I'm it, I'm blowing up\n\n[\"Bigger and better, forget about deffer\" scratched]\n\nI'm blowin' up for the fans that crave\nHip hop with relevance I'm here to save\nRap from an early grave like god I gave\nLife to the mic as I watch it enslave\nAll the sellouts who yell out\nObscenities and spell out\nM-O-N-E-Y to propel out\nOf the ghetto, but like Othello\nYou kill the mic, a cappella\nYou're in the cellar\nYou rap like\nRap is a dash for cash\nYou'll run out of gas\nIt's a marathon\nHow long can you last\nWith repetitious nothing\nRenditions of something\nYou can't create\nSo you imitate the pumping\nOnly the strongest can last as long as\nI last, my reign is the longest\nIn hip-hop history, check the book\nVictory after victory, man look\nRapping is a science, the mic is an appliance\nSo I applied it to an alliance\nOf words, put them in a rhyme song\nBlew them up, like a time bomb\nOther emcees caught the debris\nLittle bits and pieces of me\nPut my ideas on a track you laid\nIs like pulling my pin and I'm a grenade, I'm blowing up\n\nClap, your hands to that\nOld track that brought back the man that raps\nMuch better than the next man, I'll take an ex-fan\nAnd make them rock harder than any other brother can\nWhoever didn't understand my game plan\nShould feel ashamed like a lame cause I'm the same man\nThat ran the rap yard for years, worked hard for years\nBut never got paid and slaved and starved for years\nThen other rappers came off with rhymes that are soft\nI went with the flow and you said I fell off, hah\nDon't be bogus, where's your focus?\nI did what I had to, now notice\nThe dollars are rolling, no more holding\nBack the rap attack I'm back on top controlling\nThe whole rap game again, like I did way back when\nDef Jam was a dream, I was slaying men\nWhoever thinks he wants some, he don't want none\nHe's got to be insane or just plain dumb\nBut if you think you got something to prove\nJump, make your move\nBut come in a tank and ten suits of armor\nI won't whip ya, I'll bomb ya\nAnd when you're on fire it still ain't enough\nCause I don't just burn you boy, I blow ya up\n\n"

Why, oh why?\nWhy, oh why did I need Cappucino?\nCappucino, Cappucino\nCappucino, Cappucino\n\nIt was a caf\u00e9 on the west side\nIt was a caf\u00e9 on the west\nIt was a caf\u00e9 on the west side\nIt was a caf\u00e9 on the west\nCappucino\n\n"

Yo baby, I come off. Here we go...\n\n"

I let 'em know\n\n[Hook 1]\nI let 'em know\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, one an' one is two and two an' two make four\nMy name is Young, I rock the house, we're talkin' rhymes galore\nIt doesn't matter who you are, or who you want to be\nYou'll never ever rock as nasty as the Young MC\nSo now darlin', darlin' come and see my show\nYou want a ticket then I get you one in the front row\nAnd you can bring a friend, yes a girl perhaps\nAnd when the show is over, come sit on my lap\nBecause you can't resist me, neither can your friend\nIt starts in the beginnin' finishes up at the end\nAnd all these others come around and swear they're better than me\nWhen they can't even deal with the Young MC\nI mean they think they in command, but they're out of control\nThey think that they're out of jail, they're only on parole\nThey think they're walkin' on water when they're on a jet ski\nThey think they hot on the mic, they ain't as hot as me\nThey think they flyin' through the air, when they on a plane\nThey think they have a sound mind, when they goin' insane\nThey think they lyin' on the beach, when there ain't no sand\nThey think that they the freshest rapper, they ain't heard the man\nSo let me tell you party people this is how it goes\nI am the one you listen to, cause I'm the one you chose\nAnd if you think they competition, they can deal with me\nHere is my number, call the house, the name is Young MC\nI let 'em know\n\n[Hook 2]\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nI let 'em know\nBreak it down\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey said a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl\nAnd Young MC, he is a rapper ready to rock world\nI am a man with a skill, of a duty to fulfill\nOf party goers every which without the need to get ill\nNo need to scream and to shout, cause that's not what I'm about\nCause I'm a man who's rockin' the jams, to this there is no doubt\nContinuing with my tale, to never flop or to fail\nBe good to you just like a discount at a one day sale\nI'm not a criminal or hood, neither the riff or raff\nIf every rapper was a comic, I'd be makin' you laugh\nIf every rapper was a worker, I'd be chief of the staff\nAnd on a scale of one to ten, I am a ten and a half\nIf every rapper was a lion, I'd be king of the beast\nIf every rapper was a cop, I'd be chief of police\nIf every rapper was a soldier, I would be Rambo\nIf every rapper was Hawaiian, I would be Don Ho\nYou're a fish who's out of water, I'm a great white shark\nI'm a healthy burst of lightin', you're a shot in the dark\nI'm a law abidin' citizen, you're breakin' the laws\nAnd I'm a man who's almost perfect, you're filled with flaws\nThis is not exaggeration, this is straight up truth\nRap is to me what good sex is to Dr. Ruth\nRap is just like sex cause I'm aimin' to please\nBut when you're listenin' to my rhyme, you'll never catch a disease\nNow like a man once said, when you're slow ya blow\nTo prevent against this I'm always good to go\nNever ever frontin' moves, I'm makin' sure of stuff\nAnd when the mic is in my hand, that's when the stuff get rough\nCause I'm a man who's on a mission and I'm not done yet\nCause this is rougher then the roughest of the rough stuff yet\nI make noise like a smoke detector when there's smoke\nAnd I'm good to go, so now you know the Young MC's no joke\nI let em know\n\n[Hook 3]\nWord em up, I let em know\nThere it is\n\n"

This brothers got the munchies!\"\nGot off my couch, put my Gucci's on my feet\nWent to the 7-11, it was right up the street\nI ordered everythin' edible off the shelf\nHe thought it was shared, I ate it all myself\nWhen we got back to the car, Headed north then south\nI needed a drink I had a cotton mouth\nWe had so much food didn't know where to start\nAt the H\u00e4agan Daas or Kelloggs Pop Tarts\nBig bags of chips, gallons of dips\nIt took me weeks to get the taste of my lips\nI ate so much miserable is how I felt\nAlmost busted out my pants had to loosen my belt\nKickin at the tube, watchin' none better than\nYou know the king of late night, Yeah Dave Letterman\nNot too hilarious, jokes kinda plain\nBut everything is funny when you're smoking Mary Jane.....\n\nOutro:\nMary Jane\nMary Jane\nYeah... Tell 'em 'bout it baby\n\nI'm in love with Mary Jane\nShe's my main thing\nShe makes me feel all right\nShe makes my heart sing\n\nMary Jane\n\n"

Rhythms... Rhythms...\nYeah...\nDo it!...Do it!...Do it!\n\nOne, two, buckle my shoe\nSo many funky, fresh rhymes, man, I don't know what to do\nI begin to say 'em and M plays 'em\nThey bust us on a tip. We just daze 'em\nI make up the rhymes (easy). Mike is the scratcher\nJust like Duncan Hines cooking up fresh batches\nSeveral raps are paper, but most of them scatter\nKeep most the funky ones in my head, so it don't matter\nA saying, a skit, a practice or rehearsal\nThere's one more song for the press to call \"controversial\"\nIt's no cartoon-I don't see no animation\nYou try to fuck us up because you'll be filled with agitation\nCircumstances, might not allow me to bust\nBecause they know I got more game than Toy-R-Us\nIt's not Monopoly or Rubik's Cube or game of Chess\nTone-Loc, MC, getting A's on his test\nCause you're out there, your mad. I know you want to hate us\nBut you're forsake 'cause my DJ's got rhythm\n\nRhythms... Rhythms... Rhythms...\nOh yeah...\nDo it!...Do it!...Do it anyplace...\nAnna likes to be...\nWith all LOC\nAh, girl...\nWhat are you doing to me?\nOh, I like. You know it\n\nIt ain't a miracle so don't get hysterical\nI'm on the mike with a serious scenario\nIt's on your radio and coming from the stereo\nAnd don't you cut it until Loc say so\nThe main attraction, give us satisfaction\nA slayer and a player getting plenty petty action, yeah!\nHip Hop it and rocking a star\nI will climb up any mountain just to get to the top\nCause women they see go down in a valley\nA down brother, cool cooling in Cali\nCali, 'ey, is the place I stay\nWhen it rains on the west side streets of L.A\nA lot of people ask me why I started rapping\nI say, \"I don't know, it just kind of happened.\"\nI had a few 40's, I was drunk to the core\nSitting at the club, homeboy, I was hell of a bored\nThen all of a sudden it hit me like a shock\nTone-Loc was in the place and it was time to rock\nJust to freshen up my breath, I chewed a stick of Dentyne\nAnd then I quoted on the mike with fresh routine\nYou know it\nAll questions answered\nAnd the case is closed\nTone-Loc in full effect. You know what I'm saying?\nThis is going out to all my homeboys on the west coast\nDown south, up north, midwest. And of course, to all the chilling posses back east\nBrooklyn, Flatbush, the Bronx\nMoney-making Manhattan, Strong Island\nWhat's happening you all? How are you all living? Sure your way\nAh, back to the west coast\nWest side L.A., East L.A., Compton, West Side, Watts\nHow you all living?\nLittlewood\nDina. What's up Dina?\nHey, it's still a \"Mr. Dina\", ha hey\n\n"

No, I put you to a test\nThe rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)\nWith topic blend, this makes me a hard one\nPersevere, I'm here, gets taught one\nStrength producer, I send you an ultimatum\nHardcore worldwide is how I take 'em\nI rock, never hyperventilate\nOthers get tired, could use a commercial break\n45 King, DJ Mark's my alias\nIt takes a ton of MC's to prevail against me\nJust listen, I'm unstoppable\nYou want a mission?  This one's impossible\nBeats rock all night with no curfew\nMy talent's advanced, you haven't a clue\nHow I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it\nIf the style fits, I wear it\nMany attempts were made, none was recognized\n45 King said sample soundified\nI'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next\nYou pretty good, but not quite a legend yet\nStudio mixer, I got the formula\nAnd said the man from self, I'm warning you\nIt's my domain, just ask my chauffer\nMy ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa\nOn top, it's a usual act\nCan't wait to get down to 45 Studios\nI'm into rap, but no urge to sing\nI'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing\n\n"

    "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1: Dana Dane]\nOnce upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene\nIn the project that they called Fort Greene\nThere lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name\nTo make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane\nI lived in a house with my cruel step-dad\nAnd two step-brothers who treated me bad\nI cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors\nAnd I was like an errand boy runnin' to the store\nMy brothers, they used to boast and brag:\n\"We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!\"\nEven worse than that, to make me feel low\nThey gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols\nGirls used to say, \"Dane, you're so cute\nBut you gets no rap with them polyester suits\"\nWell, one day, up the avenue\nThere was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew\nHe said, \"Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!\nThe princess is having a royal ball\nIf you can rap, also dress fresh\nYou might win a date with the sweet princess\"\nWell I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash\nI bust through the door, straight to my step-dad\nI said \"Step-dad, may I?\"\nAnd before I could finish, \"Hell no!\", he replied\nMy brothers were goin', they were geared down\nEven Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown\nThey flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted\n\"We can and you can't\" is what they taunted\nThey all stood there laughing in my face\nAnd as they walked out they said, \"Clean up this place!\"\n\n[Chorus]\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nBut I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nYes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n\n[Verse 2: Dana Dane]\nWell I shrugged, I hissed, \"They're all tryna diss\nI'd get them back if I had one wish\"\nBefore I could make my thought a phrase\nThere appeared a man from a puff of haze\nHe said, \"What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb\nI'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!\nNow I've came here with the main purpose\nOf granting you your fondest wish\"\nI said, \"Hurb, my man, just make me fresh\nAnd I'm sure that I can handle all the rest\"\nWith a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot\nAnd I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit\nOn my feet there was argyle socks\nAnd a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop\nI showed him my hat and don't you know\nWith a snap the hat became a Kangol\nOnce again his hands began to flow\nThen he changed my skateboard into a Volvo\nHe checked me over, passed me the keys\nAnd said, \"One more thing before you leave...\nYou must return before the stroke of twelve\nOr you'll turn back into your old self\"\n\n[Chorus]\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nBut I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nYes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n\n[Verse 3: Dana Dane]\nI jumped in the Volvo, went on my way\nI got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say\nIt was after eleven when I rocked the mic\nAnd by the time I left the stage the people were hyped\nThe princess was staring in disbelief\nReflected from her eyes were my gold teeth\nShe waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'\nThen gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'\nI left the stage, girls came in flocks\nFists were swingin' from the hard rocks\nI heard a sound, not a tick nor tock\nGong! First bell before twelve o'clock\nNo time to waste, I broke out in haste\nThe princess followed in a futile chase\nA quick steady pace is what I kept\nLost one of my Ballys on one of those steps\nFor the Volvo I continued my stride\nAbout this time I heard gong five\nI was down the block when I heard gong eight\nAnd the princess scream out, \"Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!\"\n\n[Chorus]\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nBut I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nYes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n\n[Verse 4: Dana Dane]\nI was almost home when my luck ran out\nAnd there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes\nMy fresh Volvo also went too\nAnd there was no denyin' that my night was through\nThe one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported\nJumped on my board, for home I skateboarded\nMade it to my pad, no time at all\nWent to my room, or better yet the four walls\nHid the shoe away still feelin' pleased\nThen jumped in my cot to catch some Z's\nEarly the next morning when I awoke\nI threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat\nWent into the front, my family stared at me\nSayin' \"Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be\"\nThey kept askin' me as I did my chores\nMy butt was saved by a knock on the door\n\"Who is it?\", that's what my brothers barked\n\"The princess\", this sweet voice remarked\nShe said she was lookin' for a certain man\nWho could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand\nThe family ran around with their heads in the air\nBringin' on shoes from everywhere\nShe just shook her head, a nod of relief\nSayin' \"No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief\"\nI ran in the room and got my shoe\nAnd said, \"Is this the one you're referring to?\"\nWell she said, \"Yes, and you're so cute\nBut where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?\"\nI put on the shoe, there came a flash of light\nAnd I was tough in the gear from just last night\nLooked out the window, saw the Volvo\nSaid to my family, \"I've got to go\"\nWe drove up the avenue, the princess and I\nAnd in back of me I heard my family cry...\n\n[Chorus]\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nBut I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)\nYes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n\n(Cinderfella!)\nYes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame\n(Cinderfella!)\n\n"

The cab slowly moved off\nShe was holding my hand and it felt so soft\nNow on my ear she gently chewed\nAnd I knew it was more than just gratitude\nI took it upon myself to take her to my house\nI guess she didn't mind because her clothes were doused\nPaid the cab his fee\nTook out my house keys\nOpened up the door, said \"Enter please\"\nTook her to the bathroom, said \"Hang your clothes on the line\"\nAnd gave her one of my shirts from Calvin Klein\nWent to my room took off my wet wardrobe\nI freshened up a bit and put on my silk robe\nWe met in the front near the roaring flames\nWhere we sat quietly sipping on champagne\nHer eyes said \"Thanks\" beyond the use of words\nAnd the crackling flame was all I heard\nIt felt as though we were on our honeymoon\nAs we moved from the front into the bedroom\nWe made passion love the night we met\nAnd by the time we fell asleep there were no regrets\nWell, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might\nI guess you would call it love at first sight\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI woke up the next morning.  She was not there\nMaybe she's fixing breakfast or doing her hair\nI got out of my bed, threw on me house coat\nWhen I noticed on the mirror she'd left a note\nSaying, \"Sorry Dane, I could not stay\nPlease meet me 1 o'clock where we met yesterday.\"\nWell, I had time.  Two hours and a half\nSo I laid out my clothes and took a bath\nI ate a good breakfast, had time to spare\nSo then I got dressed and I dally over there\nI reached my destination not a cloud in sight\nIt was cool, kinda windy, but the sun was bright\nNow I was on time, but she didn't show\nAnd that was about twenty minutes ago\nI stayed a little longer, about a half an hour\nFelt a raindrop, maybe it's a sun shower\nI was soon to see that my thoughts were wrong\nBecause the raindrop became an all-out storm\nAnd there I was standing in the rain\nAnd the lady that I looked for never came\nWell, I was hurt and it showed in my face\nAs I tracked in the rain backed to my place\nSlowly I walked hoping to bump into her\nMe be in love? Nah, I barely knew her\nI got home angry and depressed\nAnd my Bally shoes were a total mess\nBut that was the last thing on my mind\nAs I sat on the couch staring into time\nWell, I had her number and she had mine\nBut if she really wanted me she would have dropped me a line\nBut day after day and weeks went by\nBut she didn't call even to say, \"Hi\"\nI would have called her first, but I've got my pride\n\"And I really don't care\", to myself I lied\nNow, there was no reason for me to be sad\nJust remember that good time that we had\n'Cause I learned a little something that you should know\nTo keep some things you got to let them go\nWell, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might\nI guess you would call it love at first sight\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro]\n... Well it was nice knowing you\nYou take care of yourself\nOh, and don't give out my number\nThanks\n\n"

That ugly black creature\nPaused for a minute standin in the door\nThen I broke out when the girlie went raw\nWord em up, Doc, couldn't stand the smell\nHeard of 3D?
