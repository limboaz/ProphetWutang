the song that she is gonna sing-sing\nWe party all night to the people's delight\nCause everybody knows that we rock out of sight\nSay we are the best in the creation\nWe go by the name of the Mighty Zulu Nation\nWe're the Mighty Zulus, we're one of a crew\nWe're comin by, we're comin through\nWe're worldwide and we're citywide\nCause we shock the house, we shock it right\nWe'll say a little somethin to let you know\nThat my mellow Smitty D is on the echo\nWe do a routine and put on a show\nAnd we dedicate it to the people we know\nWe're one of a kind, we're easin the mind\nThe Zulu Nation say time after time\n\nTo the party people out there, we want y'all just to know\nThat we are the four MC's and we are the star of the show\nAha, at every Zulu Throwdown, say this is what you see\nAnd hear the voice (I'm Chubby Chub) (Ice-Ice) (Little Ikey C) (Lisa Lee)\nWe rock in the sunlight or any kind of weather\nCause we are the Force (everybody) that has our act together\nWe wanna party (party) dance (dance) and boogie all damn night\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\nWe got to amaze all you people that we're one hell of a sight\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\nSay standin up here are the four MC's that's devine\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\nWhile the people at the door are just standin in one big line\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\nNow some of our voices are high, some are low\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\nBut it don't make no difference, we can still all yell \"ho!\"\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\nWell, the song is almost over, and emceein is an art\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\nBecause when the party's jumpin, that's when the four will start\nDo-do-do-do, do, do, do-do-do-do\n\nRoll call, I want to get down\nSay roll call, we want to get down\nSay roll call, we want to get down\nWe are the four MC's, don't need no help\nSo (check out the way)\nSo (check out the way)\nSo check out the way we introduce ourselves\n\nShe's...\nLisa Lee, and from the top of the key\nYou know I'm guaranteed to be the queen of MC's\nHe's...\nMC Chubby Chub from the heavens above\nNo, I ain't never met a girl that I couldn'd shook up\nAnd he's...\nMC Ice-Ice, the shocker-rocker on the mic\nAnd doin it on, doin it high power, doin it right\nAnd he's...\nLittle Ikey C, and I'm the melody\nNow all you young ladies get sexy\nDo it\n\nThis is a story from the yesteryear\nSaid before it was the wack, but now the ladies cheer\nUntil we climb the ladder say one by one\nAnd while we did it, we spreaded some fun\nSay we change the tempo so you can clap your hands\nAnd then we add a little (?) so y'all can dance\nAnd you like our style, which is just our voice\nSo young ladies, come and pick your choice\nChubby Chub\nIce-Ice\nI'm Little Ikey C\nWe are the three MC's\nLisa Lee\nYou're the queen\nGo girl\nJust get on the mic and do your own thing\n\n[ Lisa Lee ]\nSo put your hands in the air and listen to me\nCause you listen to the voice of MC Lisa Lee\nDon't play no games, don't bite no style\nWhen you came through the door we gave you a smile\nWe want you to get loose, get ready to rock\nWe're gonna paralyze your mind and put you in shock\nWe're gonna make you wanna yell, scream and shout\nWe're gonna let you know without a doubt\nExactly what we be about\nRockin to the sounds that make you dance\nMake the ants crawl in your pants\nPut you in a music trance\nListen to the beat and let yourself go\nCause everybody knows this is nothin but a disco\nRock, shock the sure shot\nThis ain't a Broadway play or a high school plot\nIt's the real deal that makes you feel\nLike, like you got sex appeal\nNow party people in the place you feel the bass\nCan you check out the highs, check out the grace\nSo wallflowers in the house, this is your chance\nTo show everybody that you can dance\nPunk rock to the left, and Patty Duke to the right\nMove your body now, you can do it all night\nThese are the devastating words that you never heard before\nI'm Lisa Lee, hah, I got rhymes galore\nSo young ladies out there, he's from the heavens above\n\n[ Chubby Chub ]\nThat's right, never met a girl that I couldn't shook up\nSo won't you clap your hands and have some fun\nIt's the super dynamite (huh) MC Chubby Chub\nYou don't stop (hah) you don't stop (haha)\nGet it all together, girl, because we're startin to rock\nAnd to all the young ladies, yes his name is Chub\nSay I didn't come here to ask for your love\nCause I'm a cool, cool kid with a healthy mind\nAnd I figure that (?) will always take time\nI'm lookin for a girl that I can call mine\nWhen she walk down the street, the sun will shine\nAnd to all the young ladies, I'm talkin 'bout me\nCause I'm lookin for a girl that's so unique\nI'm not lookin for a girl that drives a car\nTo me she'll always be my superstar\nCause I'm lookin for a girl with a beautiful smile\nAnd a young lady that's worth my while\nYoung ladies out there, don't you get uptight\n\n[ Ice-Ice ]\nCause it's me, baby doll, MC Ice-Ice\nJust like a bike got wheels, sweet lemon peel\nNow the MC's, they know the deal\nThat we always rock and we can't be stopped\nWherever we rock and hit the latest spot\nI said the other MC's are standin tall\nBut the taller they are, the harder they fall\nCause we the, the Funkadelic on the microphone\nBecause we are the MC's that's all alone\nAnd when we get on the mic it's back to back\nI said that we're the crew that leads the pack\nAnd we'll teach ya lessons that you'll never forget\nBecause we are the MC's that (?)\nWe're on to the crack of dawn\nWe're on to the crack of dawn\nAnd young ladies, he's from the top\n\n[ Little Ikey C ]\n(He's) Little Ikey C and I'm the master rock\nYa don't stop, ya don't stop\nTold you 'bout the ding-da-da-ding-da-ding-dingy-ding\nThat thing that you call that body rock\nNow let me tell you somethin that caught my eye\nIt was a real jazzy lady, she was so fly\nShe had long hair and clothes so fine\nI said, \"I'ma keep rappin until you're mine\"\nI said, \"I'ma rap for just about a hour\"\nCause I knew the young lady was surely high power\nAnd the way she moved was like a graceful swan\nAnd we can make love to the break of dawn\nAnd the way she move is like a graceful dove\nSay could it be I'm fallin in love\n\"Will you be mine\" is what I say\nWhy don't you chill out, just gimme the play\nYa don't stop\nYa don't stop\n\nSay what's the name of this Nation?\nZulus\nZulus\nAnd who's gonna get on down?\nBambaataa\nBambaataa\n\nSay what's the name of this Nation?\nZulus\nZulus\nAnd who's gonna get on down?\nJazzy Jay\nJazzy Jay\n\nSay what's the name of this Nation?\nZulus\nZulus\nAnd who's gonna get on down?\nBambaataa\nBambaataa\n\nSay what's the name of this Nation?\nZulus\nZulus\nAnd who's gonna get on down?\nJazzy Jay\nJazzy Jay\n\n"

(Don't let no one say you can't make it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (When things go wrong just overtake it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (Just tell yourself I've got to make it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (So c'mon everybody, let's shake it!)\n\nSuffering and misery from day to day\nI kept my faith and I knew there was a way\nTo let those things be understood\nThings that look bad can change to good\nAnd if you want things bad enough\nTo be a winner you must stand tough\nCause quitters kick the bottom shelf\nSo just remember, believe in yourself!\n\nYou've gotta believe! (Don't let no one say you can't make it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (When things go wrong just overtake it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (Just tell yourself I've got to make it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (So c'mon everybody, let's shake it!)\n\n[Break]\n\nYou've gotta believe!\n\n[Break]\n\nCause I'm looking forward to a better day\nThe Lord works in mysterious ways\nI don't know what tomorrow will bring\nI just hope that it'll change some things\nThe man upstairs, he has his plan\nHe won't give you more than you can stand\nSo when it looks like there's no other way\nJust remember these words I say\n\nYou've gotta believe! (Don't let no one say you can't make it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (When things go wrong just overtake it)\n\nYou've gotta believe! (Just tell yourself I've got to make it)\n\nYou've gotta believe!

you\u2019d be counterfeit\nI gotta give it you, though, you can rock\nBut everybody know you\u2019re on the Furious' jock\nAnd I remember, Busy, from the olden-times\nWhen my man, Spoonie G, used to sell you rhymes\nRemember that rhyme called, \u201cDitty-Ba-Ditty\u201d?\nMan, goddamn, that shit was a pity!\nToo hot to trot, here to rock a spot\nSpoonie G rocked it whether you like it or not\nHe begged for the rhyme, asks for it twice\nHe says, \u201cSpoonie G, I\u2019ll buy at any price!\u201d\nWhen Spoonie finally sold it, oh, what a relief\nBusy B stole it like a fuckin\u2019 thief\nCame

spot\nHow can I take a title you ain\u2019t got?\nYou\u2019re not number one, you\u2019re not even the best\nAnd you can\u2019t win no real emcee contest\nCelebrity clubs and bullshit like those\nThose the kind of shows everybody knows\nCelebrity clubs, those are the kind you can win\nThey\u2019re all set up before he comes in\nBut in a battle like this, you\u2019d know you\u2019d
