It's time for math\nLets add and divide to get the ones that glide\nNow it's time to subtract\nI pledge allegiance to only the black\nTake me to war for that\nRemember it's God you'll be fighting\nI am light with words my third eye spread wings\nTo fly like birds\nThat's when I spotted your plan\nRemember I am black man, the first man\nAnd sooner than later I shall be the last\nI will survive your blast\nMy mental when walk when your physical's ash\nI am Sun\n\nLords of Light!\nThere was an eclipse of the sun\nThis eclipse was unlike any other\nIt rained but the ground was not wet\nThe very next day the sun does not set\nCrash! now there's blood on the moon\nFlash! the first seal came soon\nI step onto my patio to view the glare\nAnd the air was of a lukewarm texture\nI am calm, there's no time to be tense\nTo be reflective prepare\nTo get back to the essense\nSuddenly I am greeted by a hand\nIt is Malcolm X the X is now known\nI am walked with then I am shown\nIt is time, now I see the light on the chrome\nAnd I don't need no sunglasses\nNo more lessons and no more classes I'm there\nYou had best prepare for the coming of all\nWhen the smoke clears I'll stand tall\nLook at you devil now you're sweating\nI'm telling you, you can't run\nFrom the hand of Armageddon\n\nSo now you dare to harm my physical\nWith your chemical warfare\nThe beast don't care\nThat's why he eats his pig steak rare\nSo he can taste the blood\nLike a bitch trying to feast on a plug\nGet ready to attack\nNo sweating as we march to armageddon\nMarch! all the black hut-2-3-4\nMarch! all the black hut-2-3-4\nMarch! for the time is now\nSooner than later the devil shall bow\nI will witness this\nRed black and green with a tight fist\nI dream of the day when all the blacks\nSit down to chill and unite as one\n\n"

Go out and take that shit\nAnd for the record, my crew had a show we ripped that shit\nAy for the record, whenever this shit drops\nAy for the record, just because you in the club you ain't hip-hop\n\n[Murs]\nI hit the spot, givin up that index finger and thumb\nTo let you know where I'm comin from\nLiving Legends bitch, don't act dumb\nCause some will wanna denounce the name\nSome nerd-ass niggas, without an ounce of game\nTape sounds the same as the rest of 'em\nMurs ends the careers, of the best of 'em\nI mean this nigga starts battles in empty rooms\nAnd after I consume my shadow\nI'mma travel to your homestead, blow you out in front of your own hedge\nFirst fly off the dome like led in gunfights\nFuck everything you done wit'cha whole life\nAfter battlin me, you'll only remember this one night\nPlay it over and over again in your mind like Bill Murray\nIn a hurry to escape, but just to fuck wit'cha head\nI put the shit to tape, not just for you\nBut for every MC, so you can peep where you at\nAnd see, where you need to be\nProceed with me, through them underground catacombs\nWhere the Living Legends roam\nPerfectin the techniques to speak, on phones type micro\nThinkin you, buildin a reputation, just perpetuatin the cycle\nIf all were fallin to the slang, fuck with me\nTake a bite out \"Self Destruction\" like \"We're All in the Same Gang\"\nY'all niggas can't hang\n\n[Hook: Murs]\nFor the record you a bitch, we gon' treat you like a bitch\nAy for the record, pick a style, don't ever switch\nAnd for the record, that whole tape you gave me was weak\nAnd for the record, next time you see me, don't even speak\nAnd for the record, it's always freestyle never written\nAnd for the record...\nAy for the record, this is only the beginning\nAnd for the record the Legendary saga, is never-ending\n\n[Murs]\nI'm from a crew of the most hated, underrated\nMC's on the planet, yes I cram to understand it\nAnd hopefully shed light\nIn a time when niggas is hopin on open mics\nInstead of what they write\nI compose prose to leave foes froze like Bobby Drake\nGo below zero with the flow and never break\nEver make a man come to tears\nAfter rippin his ass, in front of his peers?\nThat's the shit I live for, and that's why you live in fear\nI'm the man known only as Murs\nMakin you recognize and submit, after only one verse\nWake Up Show wouldn't play it, even without the curse\nYou gotta kiss they ass first; but I bet they stop\nAll that politickin after they get they ass kicked by Murs\nMy aim was never to play games, on some Parker Brothers shit\nI've been on some dark and other shit, for a while now\nThe style now seems to be independent, and well connected\nFuck that, my family stay independent, and well respected\nThis shit's directed\nTo every nigga comin up short, when the cash gets collected\nYou can pick up this record\nWherever good music and true skill are still expected\nCheck it\n\n[Outro]\nHey, hey Murs! Hey you remember me man\nHey you tore my ass in front of the club last week\nY'knahmsayin? Hey, hey check this out\nYou're the greatest, you're the dopest freestyler I've ever met\nHey can we do it again? Check it out let's battle let's do it man\nMy friends they didn't believe me\nThey didn't know about it, but I know you've got it\nHey Murs, hey, I I I I can't help but sayin it\nYou're so dope Murs!\n\n"

exactly who I are, yeah\nAnd I love keepin true and avant-garde\nNobody likes to be a waterboy forever\nNever seeing the field thinkin you got it together\nPlaying foosball in the street\nIt's yo' game but it's they concrete\nAnd it's my ball, it's my treat\nIt's my world, it's my head\nI live in a hellhole in the wall\nAnd i'll never see the light of day\nSubliminals controllin all of y'all but they won't take mines away\nWhat is that instinct to react before you think\nAnd'll make that thought complete\nTell it to the weak, smell before you eat\nSee I never try to mislead and I walk

me back like water in a dam, but I won't be held\nEven though on a trail with bread crumbs\nI'll take it to the max headroom\nYou'll need more than excedrin\nCodeine, morphine, nicotine, caffeine\nIn yo canteen in your blood stream\nI'm a well oiled machine, keep my area quarantined\nFrom the gardens of Florentine to the shores of Tripoli\nScientifically ain't no river me, I'm terrifically well spoken\nSee many attempts to get a glimpse to see what the hell I'm smokin'\nBut it ain't no 'bama, I just mastered this bastard grammar\nI go outside my parameter and stretch out my diameter\nIt gets

fair but who really cares\nI know some people thats over here but they wanna be over there\nI know some real cool cats yeah, but they wanna be bears\nAnd when I see 'em chasing chickens, I get heated like a flare\nOn your face looks scared, your spacesuits got a tear\nYo' a square and I'm beyond compare and I'm rare\nYeah and I'm sick of turning apples into pears\nSoon as I get a little bit of it,

you knows how to climb, you'll be there before they mount up\nNow count up all your memories, divide that by your fantasies\nCause ya wanna live life so glamourously, glittery and all shimmery\nSee everydays a jamboree but with good times comes misery\nAnd misery enjoys company so I hope you got your sensory\nNow it really don't make no sense to me, the increasing intensity\nAnd that test is out

being dumb ain't cute to me\nYo I got somethin' I found out I could get y'all all involved\nJust watch the bouncin' ball but see it don't bounce, it revolves see\nNow I don't think that I'm unreasonable\nJust because I don't really have to have no need a reason to flow\nEvery season I go squeezin' they hands\nAnd I lead 'em along see\nI leave dem a long line of slack and then pulls it right back\nSee if I give 'em too much, they might mistake my kindness for weakness\nIf I don't give 'em enough, they might think I don't possess uniqueness\nBut on the contrary, I got the bombest berries in the fruit tree\nWith the nutrients to cleanse and rinse your bodies of all the toxins\nI locks in, I use my viewfinder, I'mma give you a reminder\nI'm on a straight and narrow with no blinders, no blinders\nAnd I still see the rhymes designers that bite like sidewinders\nWith ten toes down, I spin flows round and round at an angle with anger\nThe angular warlock like strangler\nSociopathic, graphic, psycho symptom drastic plastic coded, bloated\nJust like fatty tissue acid, I'm jurassic\nI unmask it with a breadbasket full of molded yeast\nBecause the stenches'll clinch ya once my gases are released\nSo just inhale cause you know you know you inhale\nAs it is in heaven, this is to all the sistren and the brethren\nAnd it goes.... thank you\n\n"

the fireplace\nGet you hype when I lick it, put it by your face\nSipping red wine, is it bedtime\nYou can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith\nI'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay\nLingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play\nWe got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice\nBubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right\nIt's your night, no

to the floor, to the bed, to the sink\nAnd we ate each other like candy\nUnder the covers, two intimate lovers\nYou fuck a nigga like you mad at me\nThrow the ass to me\nYou should be glad to be\nIn

a trois suggestions\nStarting to get an erection\nGuessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing\nComplexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave\nI need time to breathe\nWanna follow me, ironically\nYou pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe\nLike it's my fault\nBut you don't wanna talk\nDon't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden\nYou and the shorty start scuffing\nNow shorty dumping you out\nCan't let her get the best of you\nSo I rescue you\nOnly thing left to do was to grab her\nSo you can jab her, get a cheap shot\nYou don't wanna feel chumped\nNow here the cops come\nSo we gotta run to the ride\nThen we drive off through the traffic\nDon't panic, but you know how we gotta manage\nLooking at your face\nAnd the damage in your facial\nEvery angle can't let it faze you\nNo reason to be insecure or immature\nBaby girl, see the world is yours\n\n[Chorus]\n(You're a big girl now)\nFully grown with your hormones now\nGot your own home and you alone\nWanna bone,

Bout these young sweet hoes\nSo tick tock, it don't stop the hustle\nDonna went down lip locked on my love muscle\nI'm JB the Beta manipulator, let me begin\nIf my dick is in your mouth then my balls is on your chin\nBalls is on your chin, the pubic hairs is up your nose\nI'm that nigga that gives and you that nigga that blows\n\nCHORUS\n\n(Brotha Lynch):\nAround the corner from me\nLight skinned, packed, she stood\nMuggin' like a maniac in a straight jacket\nIt was on and crackin'\nKnowin' I shouldn't be late night fuckin' with that shit\nBut I was off this Perry Mason bout to act like Jason\nIt was Friday the 13th, my day to work meat\nA pack of Blacks, and a half a 20 sac of the Thai and some O.E\nYou know me, I fuck long and nut long\nHit you in the face with some of that silky\nHot and sicc and make you mind strong\nGrab your knees and let me lean back\nI'ma grip your clit with my lips\nAnd motivate, coordinate 'g' shit\nSpeak Japanese up in your shit\nWatch it all ease up out your shit\nAnd we did it, and did it, and did it......\n\nCHORUS\n\n"

thoughts turn homicides\nYou gots to die, for tryna ride and get me\nGot some off, but none of them hit me\nNow on a payback tip, with a pitch black mask\nOn the grass with a 50 caliber

stolen\nStrapped up and ready in case these niggas wanna get deadly\nWe can go there, I know there's a place for busta niggas like ya'll\nBut I heard it's pretty deep down so you niggas better watch your fall\nToo late for that 911 call, this murder's already in progress\nHome invasions like Asian got me obsessed like a Vietnam vet\nAs I kick through the front door, blastin'\nAnd Lynch kicked down the back\nOperation: Peel-a-cap, you fools shoulda already had your gats loaded\nCuz it ain't no tellin' when we comin'\nBack streets, sacks of weed get blazed as we gunnin' with the engine still\nRunnin'\nCuz real killers make them real quick get aways\nSpray the whole place and skirt\nAs quick as we can, we does our dirt\nWhoever gets hurt, that's business\nSo please don't take this personal\nIt's just that murder's in my nature\nSo four years now, that's what I've been searchin' for\nCuz doin' dirt grows old when it's the same old thing\nThat's why I try to take my murders to the highest extreme\nMake everybody scream, open up some spleens\nStill hearin' the blood spillin'\nIt's just a little dream that I be havin'\nMan, I love killin'\n\n(Brotha Lynch):\nI got a hard dick

streets and dates\nAnd how many times niggas' hoes' got raped\nMr. No Prints, the reason one time runs out of yellow tape\nFuckin' with a half deck, havin' niggas on hush\nSmokin' a bowl that I re-dust\nOpen up your chest when I bust\nSo suit up, cuz it's kill a nigga night\nAin't no tellin' when Triple 6 gets to shootin' up\nMovin' up your death date, with a Tre-8 special\nIt's way too late to wrestle, as I nestle the sword stoppers\nSplit your ass open like pinata\nLoadin' up like a Rotweiler\nLining up like Tyson snortin' cocaine powder\nPure dank sniffer, some like a lot of fluid, but I beg to differ\nOne wiff of that shit and I'm on cloud nine\nNigga, don't trip if you ain't got no nuts\nCuz I brought mine all buffed and shined\nUntouchable when I'm fuckin' full of that nitrate wine\nThat's when I bust on nineteen times and up\nCuz I'm nuts, goin' out my mind\nFew, there's no luck, you fucked for life, for sho'\nGet your ass up on the floor\nTryin' to catch me at that lateral, slippin'\nBy my lonesome, but I'm on some, so who wants some?\nFresh out the gates, ain't no room to make mistakes\nTry to make my tapes, but I feel the ho hate\nTuck my dick inside in the O-8\nMust of been the way the clip mate with the .45\nNo body, no case\nTaste the meat, can't wait to eat\nKeep the street dirty, keep sturdy in your face\n\n(TallCann G):\nYa'll niggas don't wanna feel my nature rise\nCuz I get dirty, shoot up shit with my Clint Eastwood\nLeave your neighborhood lookin' like a ghost town, nigga\nYou standin' on dangerous grounds\nWhen we come to Sac, better have your automatics on loaded status\nCuz me and my niggas be on the savage, leavin' no prints\nNot givin' ya'll niggas a inch, cuz I'mma lynch you\nFry your guts like Sizziline\nHave your homie reminiscing' about your gangsta lean\nNigga, it ain't no fuckin' with my clique\nYou can dial 911, but it ain't no rescue\nMan, I hope the dear Lord bless you\nNext to this nigga, ain't no one's nuts bigger\nClutch your guts nigga, fuckin' with this Swartzanigga\nCuz I done lost it, taggin' niggas like a pit bull with rabies\nGone off 40 ounces of O.E\nCreepin' up on you, like doin' my Magnum

motherfucker\nStraight caught up, Fuck it though, you know\n\nSoon as a nigga steps up in the county\nI see killaz goin to the row\nIt was a riot kickin off early up in the dorm next door\nI'm up in the 9500 where the shankin is on\nIf you up in the LA county, nigga you feelin me strong\nIt's a million penitentary one OG said\nSecerity Guard fast tapped a shank up under our bed\nAnd bust them headz with a flashlight at 3 in the morning\nWaken your ass up with a BLEW, nigga put you blues on\nAnd get the fuck up out the bunk we gonna go for a walk\nPolice got a code of silence, see none of them talk\nAbout the shit that be goin on up in the County Jail\n5 guards handcuffed a nigga beat him to death in his cell\nSee 3 days is like a month, 3 months is like a year\nCause you can get your throat slit from ear to ear\nI wish somebody would help me out in the situation I'm in\nBut there ain't no luv up in the County\nCause your foe's got to be your friend...\n\nIf the guard want to come and find mine\n2 hands and a Razor blade\nThen the officer gonna have to get my\n2 hands off the razor blade\nWhen I wake up in the morning and see it again\nThen someones gonna have to end up D.D.Dead\nAnd if your Friend got soaked then he a D.D.Dead\n\nYeah you know what I'm sayin a dead motherfucker\nBarely up in there, they try to slide around all over the place\nLike a little bitch or something\nThey try to get him to calm down, but anyway it goes like this\nThey tell a nigga strip down to naked and shit\nIn the shower with thirty motherfuckers\nBut there's only ten in the shower\nThen they tear off somebodies draws and be like\nAwww too big too small, that shit ain't cool mayn\n\nVerse 2\n\nMurder, it's just a part of the game, you get you jugular opened\nUp if you say the say the wrong niggas name, I hear the guard screamin\nShut the fuck up, and as I look to my right side I see\nNiggas gettin cut, shanked, stabbed, wounded, sliced\nWatch your adam's apple when the guards hit the lights\nBut the real niggas luv me, though I'm 1990-sick\nPlus I'm not the type of nigga that won't swole up quick\nSo past me the potatoes nigga, I don't mean to be rude\nBut if you starve for a minute you gonna fuck with this fool\nUp in the county jail, niggas be startin them riots\nAnd if you see some of murder, shut you mouth and be quiet\nIf you are hard keep your shank nigga, there ain't no tellin\nWhen the mafia bailin up in the cells where the niggas dwellin\nOnly the strong survive, I ain't no motherfuckin cat\nI ain't got nine lives, so bring it on motherfucker\nI'm tellin him to bring it on in my cell\nGet my yokes on all night long\nBustin lyrics with my killa partners they so sick\nSittin around all night spittin bout G shit\nSaid he had three keys the motherfuckers call him fiends\nNow he's stuck up in the county with some niggas like these\nAin't no muthafuckin luv up in the county jail\nPicture you life a livin hell if you slangin yea...\n\nChorus with news reporter\n\nIf the guard want to come and find mine\n2 hands and a Razor blade\nThen the officer gonna have to get my\n2 hands off the razor blade\nWhen I wake up in the morning and see it again\nThen someones gonna have to end up D.D.Dead\nAnd if your Friend got soaked then he a D.D.Dead\n\nNews reporter\n\nHow a small law inforcement budget can't even put a dent\nOn an estimated 100 billion dollars of weed in this business\n\nVerse 3\n\nKeep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall\nKeep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall\nKeep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall\nAnd if you don't walk straight, then they gonna have to beat you\nUntil you have to crawl, this ain't no bullshit\nYou gonna mind somebody, niggas comin up in here\nThinkin that they bought it like they John Gotti\nAnd still get the fuck broke off\nTake the hardest muthafucka and turn him into something soft\nI keep a shank up in my sandwich, so I can do damage\nTo motherfuckers who wanna test my nuts and handle this\nLooked at my cellmate he threw up his set\nBut Trigger guy so hard died with a tattoo on his chest\nSo know this gangsta shit is poppin, the guards is comin\nMotherfuckers is runnin, I hear the Po-Po gunnin\nWhile the bullets is screamin, I hear get the fuck on the floor\nNiggas holler man damn it's the

I can't take it. I miss my peers\nTalk to my nigga, Makaveli. He's been dead for two years\nEpisodes of divine intervention, invade my mind\nGot me thinking, 'Damn I could've been dead, a couple times'\nKiller pits and extra clips, around my bed when I sleep\nStash my Glock under my pillow, twenty gauge by my feet\nSitting on my old block reminiscing again\nFor my homies dead and gone in the wind\nGone with the wind, gone with the wind\nGone with the wind, gone with the wind\n\nChorus:\nSitting on my old block reminiscing again\nPut the fire to the blunt, take a sip of the Hen\nSitting on my old block reminiscing again\nOn my homies dead, gone with the wind\nGone with the wind\n(2X)\n\nToo many niggas smile in my face and back stab\nI'm left throwing niggas in the trunk and kidnap\nThugging and loving bitches obsessed with this mob shit\nNiggas thinking they moving\nAnd bailing out the cut with the quickness\nSuckers be blind to this real shit, we bring the pain\nBossalini, Fetty Chico, Shiznilti still in the game\nImmortalized forever, having my homies up in the grave\nThinking back on when I used to drank yac in my younger days\nBust the twelve gauge shotty, too young to buy liquor\nLittle bad ass niggas grew up to be mob figures\nLiving life on a razor; cars, money and bitches\nNiggas plotting to kill us, coming in coupes in a milli's\nWe go to war 'til they feel us, bury they ass on the realest\n(not sure what is said) eliminate you for scrilla\nNiggas dying on the frontline\nSpending most of they life ducking the one time, no sunshine\nIn the world of sin, from the gutter to the pen\nGot me swimming in the game with a brim on my shark's fin\nSitting on my old block reminiscing again\nFor my homies dead and gone in the wind\nGone with the wind\n\nChorus\n\nI ain't no bitch but if you bone me I'm coming\nRunning double trying to murder something\nEyes red and heart pumping\nServing niggas out the back of the Caddy\nHitting corners\nAin't no love for you snitch ass niggas in California\nDucking suckers and shady bitches, scheming to gaffle riches\nNiggas living fictitious, running game and selling fishes\nParanoia of surveillance vans watching me close\nNigga (?) dreams died back in '94\nSuckers laid down my homey, I just had to get off\nCan't be acting like no bitch nigga, because war is raw\nThey say nice guys finish last and the good die young\nToo many real niggas put to death by the hand of the gun\nSitting on my old block reminiscing again\nOn my homies dead and gone in the wind\nGone with the wind, Gone with the wind\nGone with the wind, gone with the wind\nGone with the wind\n\nChorus (3X)\n\n"

Fish tailin on the freeway my tickets turn to warrants. Alcohol? my tiga sip?. Spittin wide eyed? mouth pieces of gip. Sink ships get chips, check the quality shit.

My nigga spanky got a hell of a beam\nSince 88' hes been a dream to fiends\nFrom state to state I gotta sling these tapes\nCDs to make so women masterbate\nEducated niggas with ghetto fame\nFamous for splittin up niggas brains\nYou reap what you sew when it comes to the game\nSwift to the fifth and now you have no name\nSince 88' dope is escalate\nNiggas out-run cops that's over-weight\nThe 1st and 15th are sacred days\nMoney and hoes flipped are different ways\nWeed is smoked at an alarmin rate\nPrepare for an attitude at the start of the gate\nMan... My minds on the money and my brain can't escape\nSo just like cakes man, I'm a sling these tapes\n\nSince 88' man, there's been a race\nEars, they open wide when game is laced\nMan... This sexy hoe, she got a hell of a face\nSo I'm a use her to fly tapes across the state\nPrices dropped and they rise like yeast\nNo shows'll have a nigga mad for weeks\nMan... My girl just quit me and I loved that freak\nSo frustration fucks is what I have in the sheets\nCrime and murder has escalate\nFun and love has just turned to hate\nGin is in and niggas drink it raw\nWatch for the task cause niggas break the law\nDon't look for trust because it don't exist\nYou talk too much to that nasty bitch\nMan... She told your plan to a hell of a dick\nHe told his click, now for a minute they rich\nSince 88' I been slingin tapes\nLike keys from Cuba or the Miami state\nTriple beam it up and see how much I'm a make\nIt's been this way man since 88'\n\nMotherfuckas drive cars that alert the law\nFinest things that you've ever saw\nMake a bitch suck dick and come up outta that bra\nFound out she was cheatin, damn near broke her jaw\nMasterminds... They got skeems for cream\nTryin to live that American Dream\nMost niggas die over bitches and greed\nFuck the rest of this song I'm bout to smoke my weed\n\n"

I floated on the scene like a butterfly, but did it like a bumble bee, so honey had to wonder why, now, you the whole truth-nothing but the truth- the rap gods baby sent me to find you put the game down, frame down, hey now picture what the broke bitch gonna say now cause they all know from the get go I say a verse from the book called Fillmoe\n\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk\n\nI'm kamikaze baby, I don't have no trust, lost in the world of the lust, looking for the bucks, sometimes you attract them ducks but everything is done on the hush.

take them grams and walk to Brooklyn\nFor the cake, but they ain't Making a Band\nI put 10 on my wrist, put 8 on my hand\nAbout 80 on my neck, cause I be scraping the pan\nI take a trip, I'm back with a tan, I'm with a diva\nSippin' Margaritas with my back in the sand\nOr I'm on a yacht gettin' my cock licked from a Chinese freak\nTryna' eat Beef Yachiniku with chop sticks\nI just got the hard top, n' I ain't got car shop\nI just hit Swizz on the phone, he on the car lot\nI'm a star, I got love for the game\nBut I'm still a thug mang, but a slug in yo' brain\nN' put blood stains on your timbs, so when the clip low\nGet low like the Ying Yang Twins\nOr your scar be all on the windows n' the wall\nI'm in it 'till the end y'all, win, lose, or draw\n\n[Beat 4: Dirt Of Your Shoulder]\nMy name Cassidy, I know you remember me man\nI hold twin revolvers like I'm Yosemite Sam\nI ride with the 4-5, but I don't drive an Infinity man\nI'm the guy you pretend to be man\nThat's why when you take a

cramped in a skinny body\nN' with the mini shotty, I jam anybody\nCause I don't feel none of y'all\nN' with the raps or the gats, I'll kill one of y'all\nAwwh, Ya'll ready know I got my hand on my hammer\nMind on my cake, cause I grind for the cake\nI do crimes for the cake\nI could do the time but I ain't tryna' get a case man\nI got the gun with me, but you don't get a one fifty\nI keep the nine on my waste\nTake a knife out and put a Nike sign on your face\nI put in time for the cake, that's why I'm grateful for every dime that I make\nI got signed now dimes climbing escape\nCause my pockets puffy and it remind them of Mase, wait\nI'm a bad boy, get trash bags full of cash boy\nI'm in a Vanquish, not a Jag boy\nWhy you mad boy, cause you catch cabs boy\nN' you gettin' paid less paper then my bag boy\nYou a hater that's sad boy\nCause yo' mom even liked me, I might be yo' dad boy\nYou a messed up, I know you upset up\nBut you better watch how you talking to your step pop\nWatch, I'm a be gon' in your fridge\nN' walk around with my boxers on in yo' crib, kid\n\n"

    "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nBlack chick, white guy\nDoes it mean shit, maybe\nI don't know, but yo it never phased me\nBut either way here's one tale\nOf two like that and what prevailed\nIt started way back in the 8th grade\nIn the small old town where the two both stayed\nHe came from a family of middle class\nWhere everything he did he always had to ask\nShe came from a place that was so alone\nYou know the same old tale of a broken home\nHer mama was an alkie and more like a friend\nHad three different kids from three different men\nAnd that's just the way shit was\nCouldn't change it, couldn't rearrange it, so there it was\nAnyway the two kept on\nWith the phone calls notes, and so on and so on\nAnd after the bullshit and what'nt\nThat day came when the two started fucking\nAll the time, you know kid's habits\nEvery single day fucking like rabbits\nSneaking out the car when he was 15\nClimbing in the window and fucking all night, see\nFucking after lunch in the junior high bathrooms\nDrinking champagne and tripping on mushrooms\nHis dick was metal, her pussy was a magnet\n9th grade came:  \"I'm pregnant\"\nShit got frantic and man, Oh Lord\nIt was a tough decision but they decided to abort it\nIt might've been right, it might've been wrong\nBut one thing's for sure, it really fucked his head up\nWhere is it, who is it, how is it, was it right\nThese are the things he thought in bed at night\nA lot of people might laugh at this\nBut fuck 'em, they don't know the half of it\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playing\nBitches don't mean shit to me anymore\nI have taken my blows, I'm still standing\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow as time went on the the two kept on\nThey kept seeing each other off and on\nSee, she moved to the city and you know what happened\nBlack chick with a real white accent\nPretty girl in the ghetto, go figure\nYeah she got macked by some dope dealing nigga\nStill seeing that other kid on the side\nShe kept most of her thoughts inside\nSee all the first guy did was just love her\nWhile that punk motherfucker used to beat her and punch her\nShe was living all wild\nI think all she ever wanted was the love of her own child\nShe asked the first guy to have his baby\nHe looked at her like she must be crazy\nHe was making records and going on tour\n20,000 people hip-hopping on the floor\nAnd all that, while she sat at home and got macked\nIf she stepped out of line she got slapped\nAnd then one day she prayed to the Lord to take that guy away\nAnd he did he got caught with a loaded gun\nAnd went to jail but first she had his son\nOoh, and now what to do\nShe had no man, no money, and no clue\nNow the other guy came back from touring\nAnd she called him up early one morning\nThey hooked up, her mind was blown\nAs he began to raise her son as his own\nAnd that's a lot of shit to deal with man\nAnd if you ain't been there you wouldn't understand\nAnd people still laugh at this shit\nFuck 'em, they don't know the half of it\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playing\nBitches don't mean shit to me anymore\nI have taken my blows, I'm still standing\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow for the next year there was some good times\nA few bad times, mostly good times\nSee he was a rambling man to the bone\nHe liked women and wine and he loved to roam\nNot like she was any kind of saint\nSee in this story there's a lot of red paint\nBut time kept slipping and made her crazy\nAnd she talked about having another baby\nThe guy was like, \"Oh, Lord\"\nWe got one now that we can't afford\nBut she convinced she could handle even two\nSaid, \"I want your child or I'm leaving you\"\nI can't figure out why then he didn't run\nI guess he was attached to her and her son\nAll confused about what to do\nThat girl met another guy and was fucking him too\nSlut\nCould barely pay her rent\nAnd then the same old shit, \"I'm pregnant\"\nAnd if that ain't some shit, cuz\nThe girl didn't even know who the father was\nAnd still by her side the first guy stayed\nHead getting more fucked by the day\nHe stuck it out for nine months, I don't know why\nAnd then a little girl on the Fourth of July\nWas born in the front seat of his car\nIt was amazing\nKind of like a shooting star\nHe was happy, told his family and friends\nOnly to realize later his little girl wasn't his\nAnd that crushed him quick\nSuicidal thoughts were in his head real thick\nBut before he found all that out\nFrom the same chick, another kid popped out\nAnd that shit's real ill\nGirl told him that she was taking the fucking pill\nShe must have known all along\nThe little girl wasn't his and she was trying to latch on\nThree different kids from three different men\nHistory repeats itself again\nAnd after some more shit got stirred\nHe kicked that bitch to the curb\nAnd now from her he's got a little boy\nThat makes him laugh a bit\nAnd he loves him\nBut still, you don't know the fucking half of it\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playing\nBitches don't mean shit to me anymore\nI have taken my blows, I'm still standing\n\n"

I break it down like this\n\nVerse One:\n\nYou see I don't like to reminisce about the past\nThe lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth\nEach and every wrong move the police keep count\nMake it real fuckin' easy to get stretched out\nI was at the funeral when it all began\nYou know the painful transition from a boy to a man\nLost sight of my mother at the age of nine\nDidn't understand death, nearly lost my mind\nBut see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it\nAge ten, new step family arrangement\nAt thirteen, started gettin' hair on my dick\nAnd noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit\nI would forever be hit with anything in reach\nThen my father would proceed to go to church and preach\nAbout forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked\nGettin' jump when he said and that ass got cracked\nPhysical contact was in form of a slap\nAt the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back\nCourtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap\nLeft the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black\nRan away from the house of Teresa and Nate\nInto juvenile detention where I built up hate\nI don't remember the date of the judicial debate\nBut legally I was now in custody of the state\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink\nSay what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak\nTryina contemplate the next move to make\nGotta find some way to release this hate\n\nAnd niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink\nSay what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak\nI'm trying to contemplate the next move to make\nI gotta find some way, Xzibit carry the weight\n\nInterlude: Xzibit, [J-Ro]\n\n[Damn, it's fucked up though man]\n[You know what I'm sayin']\nYo\n[The fuck you doin' in jail]\nInsane man, I don't know man, he he he\n[Yeah what's goin' on down there, gotta get out dude]\nYeah I be out in couple of weeks man\nYouknowI'msayin'\n[It's poppin' man]\nIt's cool yo fuck that\n[It's poppin' out here]\nThey can go on and on for that\n[I'm tellin' you it's poppin' man come home]\nAlright, in a minute\n\nVerse Two:\n\nAnd that was worse than the treatment I was gettin' at home\nOnly now I was fucked up plus all alone\nMy father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone\nTurned age sixteen now on my own\nStarted running with cats who carried gats cause they had too\nWith no hesitation lock load then blast you\nWithout a hassle, we in a town of hicks\nFuckin' all these chicks\nSellin' rock by the bricks\nSo we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown\nAt the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down\nScreamin' demands \"Let me see your goddamn hands (now)\"\nA.T.F. cause of handguns and contraband\nNever kept it in the house\nSo of course we clowned\nOnly found one pistol took us all down town\nWe be out by the end of the afternoon\nGettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM!\nWho would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife\nTy and Matt caught bodies\nNow they spend there life behind bars\nCatchin' scars that will not heal\nNiggas don't know the half about keepin' it real\n\nChorus 1 1/2\n\nOutro:\n\nLike this\nLike this, like that\nYeah! gotta carry the weight\nLike this euh!\nBringin' live\nYeah! yeah! like this\nIt's Xzibit\nGotta carry the weight\nLike that yo!\nLike that yo!\n\n"

Once they no longer care they're extremely dangerous\n\n[Verse 2]\nStand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean\nWhen I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines\nHit and decapitate the bird case, featherweight\nCritical thinking, while you add water to concentrate\nXzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box 'em in\nSeal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen\nXzibit run with a regiment of veterans\nI only like to come out late night, like Dave Letterman\nTime for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick\nCalling me a hater cause I don't ride dicks\nRead my lips, we got problems like Bloods and Crips\nLove the sound of clips when I load my shit\nChamber Music, this is for the ones with stone-face\nThat catch you at the right time in the wrong place\nWe unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice\nTake away your life like three strikes\nYeah, come on, Chamber Music\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo now Xzibit got a little money, I think it's funny\nHow motherfuckers think I'm supposed to share like Sonny\nClarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat\nYou don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique\nAccomplish more in one day than you can do in a week\nThe X-Man, Wolverine, one swing to make the cut clean\nEnd of all things manifested in flesh\nFuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class\nCatch a roadrash, all you smell is hash\nChronic mix, bumping the Liks\nAddicting like a Heron fix\nBear-arm from here to a hundred-twenty meters\nGet black-balled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald\nThe assassin, brother who came blastin'\nTake it without askin', rappers is all fashion\nXzibit keep mashing through\nGot any lost words?

Boots]\nCity lights from far away can make you drop your jaw\nSparklin' like sequins on a transvestite at Mardi Gras\nThere's beauty in the cracks of the cement\nWhen I was five I hopped over them wherever we went to prevent\nWhatever it was that could break my momma's back\nLittle did I know that it would roll up in a Cadillac\nAnd matter-of-fact, she couldn't see him like a cataract\nAnd on the track, she went from beautiful to battle axe\nAnd back at home, she would cry into her pillow\nVomit in the commode, I was six years old\nI would crawl onto her lap and we would hug and hold\nNever knew how she was sufferin' for my food and clothes\nShe asked me what I thought of Jesus when he broke off some bread\nI said, \"He's missin' an arm, and he seems like a pee-pee head\"\nShe said, don't cuss, and my teeth to go brush\nAnd get ready for bed, and the toilet to flush\nWith tears in my momma's eyes, I was her everything\nBefore she went out on the stroll\nShe'd tuck me into bed and sing\n\"You're just too beautiful for words\"\nI see the red and white lights as the ambulance flies\nReminds me of midnight in a dope fiend's eyes\nAnd my nine-year-old self as paramedics leave\nLeft to bawl my eyes out on a neighbor's sleeve\nTo give illustrations that are clear and clean\nI'll take you two hours back, before this scene\nEarly in the morning when the sun starts to creep\nWhen the birds start to chirp and crackheads go to sleep\nMoms was comin' in I heard her keys go clink\nWearin' nothin' but pumps, bikini, and fake mink\nEven though she served, for fifty dollars-a-pop\nHardly had enough for rent after Jesus re-copped\nThat day the landlady got her rent before he got his knot\nSlammed momma's head against the front bolt lock\nThen the pump with one arm done harm\nReached back and plowed into her head like a farm\nNever saw the act, locked in the back, I was cussin'\nHeard the blap blap of twenty head crack percussion\nAnd body blows, her body froze from bolos to the spine\nI was hysterically cryin', all she could do was whine\nShe didn't even have the strength to say, I love you Boo\nBut I said it to her and she knew that I knew\nShe was dead by the time the ambulance got on the case\nBut I never will forget the plastic hand stuck in her face\nStop at the intersection to ask Jesus 'bout directions\nLet's go to Frisco, I got very friendly vocal inflections\nMob a left at MacArthur to continue in flight\nMe and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Boots]\nThe rain dropped giant pearls, God was pissin' on the world\nOr that old man who was snorin' rolled on over and earled\nMy temperature gauge read, cold and blistery\nSpinnin' wheels made each piece of asphalt history\nThis was Jesus debut out the penitentiary\nFifteen years, but it seem like a century\nSee, he went in the pen for some other murder drama\nTwelve years old when I wrote him quote I wanna be a pimp, comma\nYou accidentally killed my mom, no player hatin' points\nYou know how bitches act, shit, exclamation points\nFirst it was a set up move, then it was the truth\nHis letters were the only thing I had as a youth\nBut his lopsided game, see, was really counterfeit\nSo my little son Dominic thinks that I'm a dick\nCause I was runnin' 'round like a little baby Jesus\nTo me women had to be saints, hoes, or skeezers\nAnd I don't think that it's gonna end til we make revolution\nBut who gonna make the shit if we worship prostitution\nAin't no women finna die for the same old conclusion\nPut they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em\nPulled into a vacant lot, the road to recovery\nPulled out my pistol as we brushed against the shrubbery\nJesus said, why the hell you pointin' a gat\nSo I pulled a piece of game I could use out the hat\nI said, \"This trip is over, we ain't finna ride on\nThis is for my mental and my momma that I cried on\nMicrosoft motherfuckers let bygones be bygones\nBut since I'm Macintosh, I'mma double click your icons\"\nHe struggled for life, then gave up the fight\nMe and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Boots]\nAnd I still remember momma\nYou're much too beautiful for words\n\n"

I'm fly like Seth Brundle\nIf you're snitching to Columbo we gon' drop you like a fumble\nNow what you make is point-oh-one percent of what the boss make\nAnd what the boss take is keeping us from living great\nIf this ain't straight you think you wanna sit down and negotiate\nYou better have a crew to help you shut down his estate\nDon't get frustrated, discombobulated\nDon't stand and debate it, get a mob and take it!\n'Til then it's food stamps, vouchers, mildew-smelling couches\nOverturned garbage cans with no Oscar the Grouches\nMaking money selling plastic pouches\nAs Mystikal would say, \"My flo' is covered wit' roaches!\"\nAbsotively, posolutely, can't do without it\nThe Shipment is delivered, come and get it if you 'bout it!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge - The 2 Sistas]\nSystematic playa-hation\nGreen paper complications\nGot my ass an education\nCan I get an application??\n\n"

I'm blowin' up in the world\n\nBlowin' up, blowin' up in the world\nBlowin' up, blowin' up in the world!\nI'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines\nI gotsta get mines, yeah...\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back\n\"Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack\"\nBlack, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona\nWith a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin' than Tony Roma's\nIn order to get straight, I gots ta to make a muscle\nLearned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle\nStandin' down on the corner slangin' fat rocks to bottles\nWith the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin' my back Hobbes\nMakin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton & gucci\nHoochies callin' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie\nNow I'm a felon, started sellin' and splittin' melons\nSome started jellin' and tellin' police just cause I was swellin'\nHangin' out on the corner playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo\nYo you'll never see G-low or-goin below\nYeah, straight gettin' fortunate,  as long as fiends was torchin' it\nIt started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin' it\nBut luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me\nThis business in drugs is gettin' too risky\nSo now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch tramps diamonds and pearls\nStraight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, \"It's a Demo\"\nAnd started chill in the limos with champagne and tinted windows\nHoppin', no time for pagers, sportin' gold chains and rings\nClockin' money and fame, nothin' changed, I'm still the same\nJust spendin' 20's and 10's at women pullin' on my linen\nThen grinnin' cause I was winnin' in this game from the beginning\nThe lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill\nSo I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills\nI turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos\nThough my dough used to be low, now I puff on cigars and blow O's\nSo catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a head crack\nGet smacked, through your cap, with the lead black\nAnd here's a new cut for pooh-butt rappers hangin' from off my two nuts\nLike they was put there by members of the Ku Klux\nSo peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl\nStraight up kid, I'm blowin' up in the world\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

Pssshhh... shit, I'd pay\nFor the directions? My whole family's in correction\nFake friends half-stepping, I'm stressing, answer question\nCan I trust you?

What\u2019s the difference?\n(Okay, You can love anybody but when you\u2019re in love with somebody you\u2019re looking at it like this: You\u2019re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)\n(You\u2019re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)\n(You might stop being in love but you are not gonna stop loving that person)\n(Maybe they ain\u2019t never been loved before or been in love before, they don\u2019t know what the feeling is to be loved)\n(She poetic)\nShe killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?\n\n"

Dick & (Mia X)]\nI don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)\nI don't know why I live this way (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)\nI don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)\nI don't know why I live this way (Don't know why, I live this way)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll my sisters keep ya head up, we ain't giving up without a fight\nThere's been a struggle but pretty soon we gonna bubble\nThough trouble be knocking on my door like every 24-7\nHeaven knows that I like to keep the bills in check and\nLetting my kids down on they birthday\nGnaws at my heart and tears me apart\nCan't let it go like this\nRacing through the malls at Christmas time, Babylon\nGot my mind on trip, December 25th ain't gotta bit\nTo do with Christ or his birth\nGreedy devils give us pagan, holler\nAnd profit off us give praise for better days\nBetter be ahead of what I said\nThird, I can see I can destroy the mental chains on our enslaved brains\nCocaine, be the aim, be the means of profit\nBut logically it tells me I'm going to jail and getting killed\nOh well, I gotta do what I gotta\nUntil a new day when I don't have to ask why I live this way\n\n[Chorus]\n\n"

Ooh oh ooh angels\n\n[Verse 1]\nPrecious little boy and girl growing up fast, in this foul world\nMama's trying to do all she can to get through the tough times\nPress rewind and go back to early days\nAnd I would do it all the same way\nKeep my babies, yeah I struggled\nBut God ain't give me more than I could handle\nSent me two angels when my life was tangled in knots\nAnd they're all I've got\nMy everything so pure and sweet\nTwo perfect little parts of me, the heart of me\nMommie, pulled some rabbits out some hats to pay the bills\nAnd fix ya meals, cause you both gave me the will power\nTo tower over obstacles in our path\nAnd when I'm sad, ya innocence makes me laugh\nSo glad to have a son and a daughter, so I strive harder\nTo keep it tight and bring comfort in your lives\nAnd I try not to bash ya dads and bring you in the drama\nThough you both know I've been the daddy and the mama\nAnd I'ma keep doing all I can\nTo make a strong black woman and man, out my angels\n\n[Chorus: Kenya & Lawand]\nOh my angels, yeah\nMommie's angels, mommie's a-a-angels\nOh angels, mommie's angels\nYou're my angels, my angels, my angel child\nOoh, mommie's angels, angel, angel\nYou're my angel, ooh, mommie's a-a-angels, angel yeah ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm ya real model\nDon't need to play no role and I don't hold, rap, or move the dramas\nFor the way my flowers blossom\nI'ma put it down and keep it real for the both of you\nExpose you to life, let you know wrong or right like\nIf y'all sell dope you might go to jail or get killed\nIf y'all use drugs y'all will destroy ya minds, lie, and steal\nLose ya self-respect, essence and ya pride\nAnd mama won't succeed the birth of ya rise, so strive\nIf y'all sleep around unprotected\nExpect to have a bunch of little children\nAll diseases that can't be cured and\nIf y'all quit school ya play the fool that's half steppin'\nIntelligent black folks are our strongest weapon, get ya lessons\nVocal sessions on the regular, eye contact\nI'm ready to take responsibility for the mine's act\nSo save that blame it on him, her, them for mine\nI'll have to find the time to shape their little minds\nThey're my angels\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'ma carry y'all till y'all can carry yourselves on ya own\nHugs and kisses way after y'all grown\nHelp ya out when ya need but stress independence\nUnconditional love, that's my life sentence, no repentence needed\nThis is how it's supposed to be\nAnd I'ma keep my children close to me\nHope to be, the best mama that I can\nPrecious Lord please take me by my hands\nAnd guide me with ya righteous wings\nCause I don't want my babies to regret a thing\nHe's my king, she's my queen\nThey're my world, thank you for my little boy and girl, mommie's angels\n\n[Chorus to fade]\n\n"

Said: 'You couldn't see\nRather drink your Hennessy like you was watchin over ME\nI was generous, hit you up a chance, time to change\nBut you rather be a knucklehead livin off a name'\nNow I'm shocked as he explained it all, vivid in a tale\nI'm feelin every minute like the blind feel the braille\nLost inside the shuffle of the bitches and the mail\nHe rolled up and told me: 'Inhale...'\n\nTo live or die by the same shit\nLeavin behind everything that it came with\nThe verdict of a life niggas play with\nTry the truth, it'll all come back to you\n\nHe said: 'I had a lotta hope for you' I said: 'I know you did'\nSaid: 'I couldn't see you on this road when you was just a kid\nBut I had to let you grow to man and use the brain I gave you\nThinkin maybe give this rap shit a crack and try to save you\nYou bein you, rather juggle with the crew\nFind some drama, break the rules, spend your money on em jewels\nAnd the tools that I gave you sat around and caught rust\nWhile the tools them niggas hit you with, you turn around and bust'\nIt's disgusting, dropped my head, threw my hands in the air\nSaid: 'I know that all in all it seemed I never really cared'\nStill and all I'm feelin scared and he said: 'You wasn't buggin\nOne of them nights you came prepared with baby-macs, started thuggin\nNow it's time for you to see exactly what it means\nWhen you're reapin what you're sowin in between...'\n...know what I mean\n\nI said: 'It's all said and done, showed the pictures, brought the facts'\nSaid: 'I tried to play it chill, but ain't no evidence to that\nBring me back and I'mma never do the same shit again\nWord to mother, daughter, son, and all my peoples in the pen\nHope you're listenin, it's hard for me to beg someone for somethin'\nSaid: 'Your problem, that's fear, too much pride, steady frontin\nIf you took the time to think about the ends and what it means\nWouldn't find yourself a million somethin feet above the scenes\nAnd I know they're goin through you, felt the pressure and the pain\nIt was all about the cream and all the props you had to gain\nFor the fame you sacrificed the love I showed, to play the game\nNow you're just another reason why the shit'll stay the same\nNow you chill with me forever, ain't nobody else to blame\nAnd the only thing you left behind's a name\nA shame you opened up your ears just a little late as I explain\nYou're just another nigga layin slain'\n\n"
