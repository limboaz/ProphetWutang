When suckers choose, they lose\nI'm like lethal, to you and your people\nIt's like an outrage, when punks step on stage\nWith the weak show, weak flow, and still make dough\nSo I'mma take dough from em, and then son em\nTeach em how to really get biz like this\nMe and my gang's gonna swarm\nBrainstorm\n\n[Verse 2: Guru]\nIt takes at least, two to tango, so you can get strangled\nFrom any angle, as I get buck on ducks\nAll the sexy girlies wanna push up close to\nThe man with the most who don't flaunt his ego\nSome motherfuckers ain't as gifted\nNot everyone can move the crowd and uplift it\nI'm swift with the shit like a bullet's trajectory\nSo don't stand next to me\nIt's like a, warm sensation when my shells hit\nYou were wrong, you know what you did, so you fell quick\nTo the pavement, no signs of body movement\nSee I knew it, yo I had to do it\nAnd it's cool to duel but don't slip up fool\nCause I'mma leave you dead and stinkin like a cesspool\nAnd all the chicks know what's goin on\nCause baby, there ain't no sunshine when I'm gone\nAnd you can beg for me to stay and parlay\nBut sorry, I gots to go, got bills to pay\nSee by nature I'm godly\nWhen I touch the mic, it's never too hard for me\nTo let out, a mass amount of mad clout\nHuh, me and my Gang's gonna swarm... Brainstorm\n\n[Verse 3: Guru]\nI'm gonna get ya\nYou might be bigger than me, so I'mma wet ya\nComing to your house to douse it with the\nMolotov cocktail, I won't fail\nBurn out your eyeballs, and leave a note in braille\nSo what the fuck you gonna do?\nYea I know I used to act relaxed but now I'm cuckoo\nCome into my darkest, deepest thoughts\nWe fought I won, and now you're caught and bein' tortured\nWater pellets dripped upon your forehead\nBut you can't move, because you're tied up\nYour time's up...\n\n"

I'm just sayin like this\nI don't whassup, but\nI think you will understand a little bit more of the situation\nI'mma say like he would say it, on this second part\nSo just check this out aight?\nJust kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head\n\nHe was a crook -- at the age of nine\nDo whatever it took -- he'll ROB YOU BLIND\nSnatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men\nWay back WHEN.. when he was only ten\nThen when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade\nTried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid\nAnd if he ever had to travel somewhere far\nTake a bus? PSSH - HE'D GO STEAL HIM A CAR!\nHe'd always choose to live his life the wild way\nTag?! Russian Roulette is what he'll play\nHis moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High\nThe way you live determine just how soon you die\nAnd he didn't care because to him it was fun\nAnd he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun\nHe robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently\nGave a new name to juvenile delinquency\nAnd yeah you know that, he, was on the go\nSeven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough\nBut he was headed for a dead end fast\nCold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last\nWent back and forth to jail six times\nFor stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes\nSo when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child\nIt don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild..\n\nAy that that that's a little bit of a lesson\nFor all the kids out there you know now\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin\nAnd this is comin from\nThe Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler\nAin't no one cooler\nIn 7th grade I had a teacher named Mr. Dulah\nWho used to wear his pants up to his chest\nAnd I want you to just listen\nCause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild..\n\n"

Vanilla Ice\nForthcomin' I'm risin' to the top\nThe real definition of funk is put to hip hop\nThat's what I though, you're cause by the friction\nPens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'\nWhat I like to hear is a drummer get wicked\nThe tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it\nDon't be surprised if your eyeballs swell\nI know it's hard to regard cause I'm loved by the females\nMasses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt\nNo one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault\nSo pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to\nMy dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you\nThe concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook\nAcknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea\nThe crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end\nAs I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands\nI go to work on the floor like a wet mop\nIf you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock\n\nChorus\n\n[Verse 3]\nThrow your hands in the air and let's get hyper\nFlip this thing and sting like a viper\nRollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent\nIf there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it\nBelieve that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be\nWith slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe\nSheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal\nThe dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal\nBut, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout\nTo rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about\nMoney, yea, is the key to all problems\nIf you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em\nCause I got the key, the key to attack\nThe knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track\nTo my foes, I can show I can flow cause I'm legit\nThinkin' of a new dance, ice will be workin' it\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

So what?

Only God knows\nMan I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes\nBut for now I'm just going to do the strut\nAnd this is what I say to girls from houses to huts\n\n[Hook]\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?\nJust because I'm poor, that's why you won't give me the butt?\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?

with the gangster glide\nKeep my game down packed\nSo i stack and stay alive\nMove on\nI do em' quite bold\nBecause the key to hustling\nIs to make a fat bank roll\nFast\nFaster than you can run\nYea

We got our own\nI'm the Divine Master of the Unknown\nAin't nothing changed, I'm the same as before\nWhen opportunity knocked I just answered the door\nCriminal at heart even though I don't show it\nI was always a winner but I just didn't know it\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

About to set the vibes right\nHe lit it with his finger, I smelled the Martian buddha linger\nI felt good cause I released some anger\nNo sooner than the cease of the herb ignite\nI was headed back to Earth at the speed of light\nUpon my return niggas thought I was in jail\nNah kids... I escaped from the world\n\n[Redman]\nAs we zone, on the cosmic type of funk\n(escapism y'all)\nWe drop mad flows, for the 1990's\n(escapism y'all, escapism y'all)\nThe Funk Doctor Spock signin off live\n(escapism y'all, escapism y'all, escapism y'all)\nThis is how we do\n(escapism y'all, escapism -- escape from the world)\nFlows enough for the nineteen ninties and we OUT!\n(escapism y'all)\n\n"

So what we're gonna do is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire. Yo Pete Rock! Make it clear\n\n[Verse 1: Heavy D]\nI can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend\nKeep a party pimping from now till then\nI don't have to swear, curse or juggle\nLyrics in a verse to make a party bubble\nSo mister censorship, tell me what's your problem?\nThere's girlies on the corner, if wifey can't solve them\nHow does she say it? I'm curious, G\nDoes she say \"honey love me\" or \"baby baby fffffun me?\"\nAnyway, we'll say what we want to say\nPlay how we want to play, feels good that way\nSo G. Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse\nDo your man a favor, and don't curse\n\n[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]\nYou're telling me don't curse on my verse\nI did it worse, first I put a curse on every verse\nI kinda got outrageous\nCheck it, even made a record how I'm doing all the B-I-T-C-H'es\nDucks, it wasn't for the bucks\nEvery word that you heard is 'cuz I didn't give a f-- aww shucks!\nHey yo, I almost forgot\nThe curse is a plot but it's getting kind of hot\nSo I'mma let profanity retire\nHey, but if worse comes to worse I'll curse you out like Richard Pryor\nSo Grand Puba, kick a verse\nBut do your man a favor, and don't curse\n\n[Verse 3: Grand Puba]\nI won't curse. I'll take a famous curse word and just say \"kcuf\"\nKcuf flipped around the other way means, huh?\nBoy, when I do it, see I can't get stuck\nJump on the mic, then I earn a quick buck\nBuck meaning loot, then I grab some boots and step with my troops\nFor those who can't follow and got stuck\nKcuf flipped the other way means . . . [coughing]\nIs this a curse? I freaked a nurse in a hearse\nBut I made sure I had my hat first\n(C.L. Smooth) It's time to kick a verse\nGod-Cypher-Divine, we can't curse\n\n[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]\nGo ahead, ask me will I kick a curse in a verse? I'll say \"nope\"\nGrab you by your hair, wash your mouth out with soap\nThinking to be the last one with the bad lingo\nScooping on the skins in the church playing Bingo\nSounds of the Mecca don, fresh from the tailor\nBecause they made a movie when he cussed like a sailor\nBetter yet dialect dirty like a subway\nFreak a funky loop and I make it go the other way\nIn a vocabulary scrimmage\nBut cursing in my village ain't good for my image\nSo Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse\nBut do your man a favor: don't curse\n\n[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]\nUhh, the smooth rap inventor that enter\nParental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor\nKids want to peep it, but you want to beep it, what?\nI feel like slapping that sticker on your (Chill, chill, say butt!)\nI'm too magical, rhymes are too tragical\nFor any source to stop Kane from getting capital\nIf I thought sticking me was dissing me, man, don't you know that this would be\nWorse than Stephen King's Misery?\nSo clean all profanity, still and yet all the man'll be\nRocking any microphone you're handing me\nSo Heavy D, I'm about to disperse\nKick another verse, and don't forget not to curse!\n\n[Interlude (Spoken): Heavy D]\nHey yo Big Daddy, check this out. I'm about to do some old sly, slick, smooth on the trick tip stuff\nI'm gonna bring my little cousin, the producer of this joint, his name is DJ Pete Rock, definitely part of one of the family, you know what I'm saying, G?\nHe's about to flex on this here mic and get busy like his big cousin, you know what I'm saying? Check it\nPete Rock, kick a verse but don't curse!\n\n[Verse 6: Pete Rock]\nGod bless, but I can't mess\nAround with the curses, so I'mma kick verses\nOr a verse, Soul Brother number 1 here to kick facts\nSmoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks\nYo I'm a bad bro, let's start the flow\nI'mma kick rhymes till it's time for me to go\nI can't curse 'cuz Heavy D said so\nNow I'mma get back to the subject, get wreck\nIf you think I'm bluffing just check\nWith the crew, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, very down to earth\nAnd we didn't have to curse\n\n[Interlude (Spoken): Q-Tip]\nYeah man, the Abstract Poet, Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest here to wreck!\nYou know what I'm saying, got my man Pete Rock and my man D in the house\nAnd we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip\nSo bust the spit out\n\n[Verse 7: Q-Tip]\nFlim-flam-flim, lick my big black stuff\nMust I kick a curse to be rough enough?\nYou can put the sticker where the sun don't shine\nSo back off and let me get mine!\nVisions in my head when it's dealing with hits\nIf I have four girls, then I lick eight [its]\nWait--don't want to hear no drama\nCause the bum-diddly-Hev is a fave of my mama's\nSo I blew out and get mad lifted\nDon't have to say [kcuf] to show that I'm gifted\nGod bless me 'cuz I reached my twenty-first\nHev D! Don't drop a curse\n\n[Verse 8: Heavy D]\nPeace, peace. Peace to the preacher\nI'm talking about a verse without a curse, that's how I reach ya\nI can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb\nBackwards, no curse words Heavy D prefers\nSo swing, swing to the silky clean rhythm\nBefore I say goodbye let me tell you how I hit 'em:\nC.L., Pete Rock, G. Rap, Maxwell\nBig Daddy, Q-Tip and, uh, me as well\nTime to say peace, thank Pete for the beats\nThis funky beat was made for the streets\nNotice how clean that we kept every verse\nBut if worse came to worse (we'd have all said a curse!)\n\n[Outro]\nFree Slick Rick!

I don't know but I'ma\nTake it upon myself, and blame it on they Mama\nFor beatin' that ass with a baseball bat\nSwole it all up now it's proper and fat\nFed 'em attitudes, Big Macs, and milk\nLeave 'em all alone and it's on in the jilt\nOr the house, cuz that's where they open up they mouth\nSo in the day she's a child, at night she's an adult\nAnd Diggity Domino I like to ride it like a tractor\nBut there's a question at hand because that age is a factor\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Domino]\nThere was a man named Bill, on a Saturday night he went to a club\nAnd read a sign before he entered it saying \"eighteen and up\"\nBut we know that's just a game for the man, that's runnin'\nThangs cuz he's lettin' all the fly bitches come in\nRegardless of the age and shit\nBut since this story's about Bill let's get back to it\nBill met a collard green, she looks mean\nRan a little game now she's on the team\nYou know what comes next, took her to the snooty\nTreated her like a salad, tossed up the booty\nBill played it wrong, and he got lazy\nNo protection, guess what, oopsy daisy!\nNow baby's pregnant\nCuz Bill neglected\nTo be protected\nNow he's arrested\nOne year under eighteen and you're through\nSo if you're game drop a line like this before you do:\n\n[Chorus (2x)]\n\n"

I've been cleaning out my nest, and I found an old book of my poetry!\n\n(Ice Cube)\nFresh out of school cause I was a high school grad\nGots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad\nWish I got paid by rappin' to the nation\nBut that's not likely, so here's my application\nPass it to the man at AT&T\nCause when I was in school I got the A.E.E\nBut there's no SC for this youngsta\nI didn't have no money, so now I got to punch the\nClock, gotta slave, and be half a man\nBut whitey says there's no room for the African\nAlways knew that I would clock G's\nBut welcome to McDonalds; \"may I take your order, please?\"\nGotta serve ya food that might give you cancer\nCause my son doesn't take no for an answer\nNow I pay taxes, that you never give me back\nWhat about diapers, bottles, and similac?\nDo I have to sell me a whole lotta crack\nFor decent shelter and clothes on my back?\nOr should I just wait for help from Bush?\nOr Jesse Jackson, and Operation PUSH?\nIf you ask me the whole thing needs a douche\nA Massengill\nWhat the hell\nCrack will sell in the neighborhood\nTo the corner house bitches\nMiss Parker, little Joe, and Todd Bridges\nOr anybody that he know\nSo I copped me a bird, better known as a kilo\nNow everybody know I went from po', to a nigga that got dough\nSo now you put the feds against me\nCause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency\nI never get love again\nBut blacks are too fuckin' broke to be Republican\nNow I remember, I used to be cool\nTill I stopped fillin' out my W-2\nNow senators are gettin' high\nAnd your plan against the ghetto backfired\nSo now you got a pep talk\nBut sorry, this is our only room to walk\nCause we don't want a drug push\nBut a bird in the hand, is worth more than a Bush\n\nTell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)\nTell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)\n\n"

Get up, man! (C'mon keep that nigga awake, man!)\nC'mon, man!

Don't move!\"\nYo, I didn't do a thing\nDon't wanna go out like my man Rodney King\nStill got gaffled\nInternal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel\nNow I'm handcuffed\nBeing asked information on my gang affiliation\n\"I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes\nAnd I'm a victim of neighborhood crime.\"\n\n[Interlude 2: Police Officers]\nAre you the only one who got shot? What kinda gun was he carrying? Do you know who it was? (No, man, don't know who it was, man) Are you in a gang? (Man, what does it matter, man? I'm shot)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI need to see a MD\nAnd y'all motherfuckers giving me the third degree?\nLook at the waiting room\nIt's filled to the rim like the county jail day room\nNobody gettin' help\nSince we poor, the hospital it moves slow\nNow I'm laid out\nPeople steppin' over me to get closer to the TV\nJust like a piece of dog shit\nNow will I die on this nappy ass carpet?\nOne hour done passed\nDone watched two episodes of M*A*S*H\nAnd when I'm almost through\nThey call my name and put me in ICU\nHalfway dead\nNo respect, and handcuffed to the bed\nNow the drama starts\nCause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart\nThen I begin the ass kissin'\nJust to get looked at, by a overworked physician\nHad the chills, but my temperature's a hundred and three\nOnly got a band-aid and a IV\nThat's when I start cussin'\nPolice steady askin' me who did the bustin'\n\n[Interlude 3: Police Officers]\nWhat did you get shot with? (Twenty-two!)\nWho shot you? (I dunno who shot me)\nWas it gang-bangers? (Had to be)\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhy, oh why, can't I get help?\nCause I'm black, I gots to go for self\nToo many black bodies the hospital housin'\nSo at 10 p.m, I was Audi 5000\n\n"

Cause Tairrie B's the one in command\nAnd i'm flowin', throwin' down to a dope sound\nSuped up by snoop underground\nIs how we do it, so the suckas can't find it\nMe and D, we're funky dope minded\nSo when you see us steppin' up on the set\nYou play the back, .jack, or you jet\nLike a bomb that's tickin' ready to explode\nT's cold kickin' ready to unload\nAnother episode, with the posse clique\nLike a Saturday matinee, Mae West flick\nI push it, punch it, pump it with poise\nPlug the mic and belt, bump it boys\nSo bring the noise it's time to do dustin'\nSwing the rhyme and I'mma keep bustin!\n\n[Verse 2: Tairrie B]\n[Sample?] is what the critics say about me\nSo all you punk little suckas that doubt me\nGet real and let me tell ya the deal\nA female emcee tryna get with me\nShe'll get slapped with the rap that I recite\nLadylike, left to right back and forth on the mic\nCause I'm an emcee, not a singer or actress\nDroppin' method on the track and the fact is\nI wear sweats not a stone washed wack dress\nAnd my man Schoolly D well he back's this doll\nCause I'm the gangstas moll\nSwingin' ya the femme fatale roll call\nMartinez is the manager my girls are hype\nI'm the emcee yeah you got that\nSo if you wanna swing you came to the right dame\nThe female mob boss\nTairrie B's the name!\n\n[Verse 3: Tairrie B]\nNow when you're 'Swingin Wit 'T'\nYou're with the rap sex symbol\nWrapped around my finger like a ring or a thimble\nI'm a diamond cause they are forever\nOn the mic my rhymin's on time and I'll never\nStop or get dropped lookin' like an Athletic\nI look so good the others look pathetic\nThey need a medic\nCause they soft and they can't hang\nSo just step off sucka it's my thang\nAin't about white or black, fact\nThe 'T' is in tact and the B is the backbone\nKnown and prone to get busy\nLeave the men dizzy like Monroe in her time\nBut in the 90's 'Gentlemen Prefer Rhyme'\nLos Angeles get with this\nAnd NYC, why even try to dis?\nIt's where you're at and not where you're from\nSo when you're 'Swingin wit 'T' you get none!\n\n[Verse 4: Tairrie B]\nWell if you missed my rhyme punk better by the book\nRappin' comes from the mind and not from the look\nSo when you look my way, word to the mother...\nDon't judge the book by the cover\nNo other woman can rock the way I do\nSo consider yourself just confide to\nCold housin' the joint and I'll slide you\nTo a point where others just tried to\nNever run outta breathe cause I'mma a pro at..\nSwingin' def lyrics, but you know that\nNot the type of girl that other girlies wanna battle\nI get amped, trample tramps like cattle\nAnd then, I ride away side saddle\nAnd yo, that'll be the end of the battle\nAs you stand there sprung with that look on your face\nThat says damn...\nTairrie B swung the place!\n\n[Outro: Tairrie B]\n\"Yeah, we swinging in 9-0\nJust like Jose Canseco\nAin't that right Joe?\nStop the show\"\n\n"

Lover, and I bust your ass\nSo next up, movin down the line\nMister Cee\n\n[Mister Cee]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nMission, to make DJ's feel the wrath\nSo here's a paragraph, written on behalf\nOf the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador\nMakin a massacre, you couldn't last through a\nRound of combat, where my left arm's at\nMy mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack\nI shake and bake or fake a snake\nTake em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake\nWhen I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt\nI'mma tear shit up\nSo next up goin down the line\nThe Little Daddy Shane\n\n[Little

no comp and I'm certain\nSo if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains\nI'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke\nOne false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!\nSo take it easy and slide on greasy\nCause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy\nI'm more rougher than steak when it's raw\nSo keep that in mind, mon cherie amore\nCause I'm a lover you find quite young\nAnd Brooklyn New York, is where I'm

back\nAnd it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack\nGot the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep\nThen I put it to sleep\nI see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place\nNot Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface\nBut I know, if some shit goes down\nI'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown\nA 'Face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard\nAnd I ain't no bullshit bodyguard\nWalk the streets to New York and stay alive\nAll I need is my loaded four-five\nAnd sweet and deadly like a killer beehive\nAnd I can stalk in Fort Greene Park and survive...\nAnd my name is Ant Live!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow that's what I'm talkin bout\nThat's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout\nPut your weight on it fellas\nAnyway you can get back to work now\nGet back to your god damn jobs\nAnd we outta here,

[Doin' the rest]\nRight, so I'm about to get into somethin' here...\n\nVerse 1\n\nI'm Master Ace, from a place\nOr should I say borough\nWhere they like the bass to be thorough\nWith the kick of a mule\nAnd the click of a tool with no bullets\nIn the clip, it's the trick of a fool\nCuz he who fronts gets blunts you can't smoke\nTo pull such stunts is no joke\nYou better know where you are first\nTry to be rude and get chewed like a Starburst\nNow how much juice you got?\nYou couldn't hang if I made a noose and knot\nNow try that on for size\nToo much baseball, too many apple pies\nClick your heels three times, kid\nAnd now you can see what my rhymes did\nSuckers and nerds come in herds just like cattle\nFirst I brand them, then I hand them a rattle\nSo they can make a little noise in protest\nThose that fussed got bust wearin' no vest\nI told that MC to go West\nLet's see who can put on a show best\nThe creep that tried to sleep got no rest\nI got a rap that can trap a slow pest\nWhere's your girl? She's out on a ho quest\nFingernail tips, red lips, summer stroll dressed\nIn a camisole she's a pro blessed\nWith a great big backside but no breasts\nWelcome to the fire pit\nI know some kids that wish you'd worn some flyer shit\nCuz as soon as you stepped off the train\nThey woulda put a big nine to your brain\nBe on the lookout, and yo, keep lookin'\nCuz there's a battle goin' on in Brooklyn\n\nVerse 2\n\nJust like the water in a river flows, I'm fluid\nAnd as I do it, I deliver blows\nSo MCs, you better keep your left up\nTry to fight and you might just get F'd up\nCuz I'll terminate, as you learn a great lesson\nDon't ever try messin' or you'll earn a fate\nWorse than death cuz I'm here to give it to ya\nYou got a life, but don't know how to live it do ya?\nI live on a day-to-day basis\nDoin' my shows in all kinds of places\nYou sit home with a frowned-up grill\nTalkin' 'bout who ya gonna kill\nWell listen up psychopath\nPut down the Uzi, stop tryin' to play Shaft\nCuz life ain't a TV screen\nBullets can puncture the skin, rupture the spleen\nAnd the stuff that flows out your veins ain't ketchup\nSit back, relax as I sketch up\nThe scene on a Brooklyn street on a late night\nIt was a great fight to me\nI was just an innocent bystander\nLet me try and, uh, explain why I'd hand a\nBrother a big fat stick\nWell it was that, or get his black ass kicked\nSee, it was five against one\nBut this brother was too proud to run\nSo he stood in like a trooper\nFightin' against all odds against a group of\nBrothers that looked the same way he looked, friend\nIt was a battle in Brooklyn\n\n"

Yeah, it was like that\nDidn't sweat a bitch cause when I left she'd know I be right back\nWe might fight, black, but it never last long\nIf you try to come between us, nigga, get yo ass on\nLike them niggas that I hang with\nLet me know they ain't down, they tryina get at my thang and shit\nHad to know what has happenin\nWasn't like the average nigga gettin caught up in that high cappin\nWhat you got don't mean shit\nAnd I was quick to get in the mix behind my bitch\nFar from a trick, and never did she ask for shit\nEverything she got, she deserved it\nYoung love in the ghetto, hello\nKnew I had a down hoe, didn't wanna let go\nStraight based on trust\nAnd while other motherfuckers got crushed they couldn't fuck with us\nTo fuck with while we were rollin was unwise, G\nCause we were fully strapped, jammin them Isleys\n(Drifting on a memory)\nToo deep\n(Ain't no place I'd rather be)\nRollin with somethin sweet\nSo unique\nYou know where I wanna be?\nYeah\nKnow where I gotta be?\nYeah\nYou know where I'm at?\n\n"

I'm sure that the rats are nesting\nThe heat doesn't work he still hasn't checked it\nDisrespected me for the last time\nI loaded up the nine stepping double time\nBullseye]\nAnother point scored\nRight between the eyes of my landlord\n\nVerse Two: Defrost\n\nThey tell me to hold my peace but I just can't\nBut I'm Defrost of the rap group of Point Blank\nSo me I'm chilling at the table with my family\nHypothetically trying hard to keep my mind off the economy\nYeah I know the reason I find it hard to pass the test\nCall me a victim cause I'm another brother jobless\nEvery day it seems like I'm moving closer to the streets\nPG&E repo'ed the lights and my fucking heat\nThe situation's getting hard for me to handle\nHad to trade my Nike's to the store to buy some candles\nLast to first and I'm a-hunted and a ho I know\nThe man is going to come and throw me in the cold\nTears in my eye as I'm thinking of place to stay\nWhile I'm staring at the freebie cheese up in my plate\nI heard a bang bang bang knocking at my door\nI looked up it was my motherfucking landlord, let him in quick\nFollowed by the sheriff deputy trying to come in\nEvery po on my property, staring me down\nMugging hard up in my family's face\nWhile they're sitting at the table trying to say grace\nBut before I make this one my last meal\nAny moves, yeah I'm looking for the damn kill\nI said it twice in case he didn't hear me though\nSucker made a move evidently when he hit the floor\nSo now I'm in cuffs for the crimes I've committed\nMaybe I'll go to jail, heh, or maybe I'll get acquitted\nBut the fact still stands I killed my landlord dead\nNow I've got three meals and a roof over my head\n\nVerse Three: Boots\n\nCash is made in lump sums as street bums eat crumbs\nSo I defeat scum as I beat drums\nRum-tiddy-tum like the little drummer boy song\nHere comes the landlord at the door, ding dong\nIs it wrong that my momma sticks a fat-ass thong\nUp his anal cavity cause he causes gravity to my family\nSays we gotta pay a fee so we can stay and eat\nIn a house with light and heat\nThe bastard could get beat, stole the land from Chief Littlefeet\nHouse is built on deceit, got no rent receipt\nSo I'm living in the street and I'm down now\nDon't you know to not fuck with the Mau Mau?\nNotice of eviction, four knuckle dental affliction\nFriction, oh did I mention\nYou'll be finger licking as I handicap your diction\nAnd you say you're not a criminal like Tricky Dick Nixon?\nWhile we're fixing to impose rent control\nWe didn't vote on it, this land wasn't bought or sold\nIt was stole by your great granddaddy's ganking\nOsagyefo said they call it primitive accumulation\nPlantations, TV stations wealth is very stationary\nI learned the game and I became a revolutionary\nScaring the corporate asses cause the masses are a loaded gun\nKilling the world banking and international monetary fund\nI'm done, we're done with what you've done\nFor twenty-five score we've got a battle cry\nKill my, kill my, kill my, kill my\nKill my, kill my, kill my, kill my landlord\n\nVerse Four: E-Roc\n\nI need six hundred dollars by the end of the week\nMy body is cold, dirty socks on my feet\nNot a black sheep, but who's the creep\nTrying to put me on the street while I'm trying to sleep?\nI wanna kill my landlord, murder in the first degree\nIf there's something wrong he wants to blame me\nWants to be a threat so he carries a gun\nWell I pack a Well I pack a 9 cause I can't trust 911 cause I can't trust 911\nSon of a gun, I'm the one who cuts the grass\nWash the windows and he still wants me to kiss his ass\nBut I laugh cause America's not my home\nMy landlord took me away from where I belong\nBut it's a sad song so I face reality now\nPick up the phone and now here comes the Mau Mau\nTo the rescue, down with The Coup\nYo landlord, I've got a little message for you\nI'm going cuckoo, fuck a machete or sword\nE-Roc is on a mission to kill my landlord\n\n"

    "lyrics": "\n\n[ VERSE 1 ]\nI used to be in love with this guy named Sam\nI don't know why, cause he had the head like that of a clam\nBut you couldn't tell me nothin, cause Sam was number one\nCause to me, oh my gosh, he was one in a million\nI shoulda knew the consequences right from the start\nThat he'd use me for my money, and then break my heart\nBut like a fool in love I fell for his game\nBut I got mine, so I show no shame\nIn Empire winked his eye, and then he kept walkin\nAnd all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin\nThe roller disco where we all used to go\nJust to have some fun back in 1981\nYou know the place, Empire Boulevard\nIs where I first saw the nigga, and he tried to play hard\nBut I knew the deal, cause I knew his brother Jerry\nAnd Sam, he just broke up with his girlfriend Terry\nSo Jerry introduced Sam and I that night\nHe said, \"Hello, my name is Sam\" I said, \"Hi, my name is Lyte\"\nWe dipped and we dapped and we chit and we chat\nAbout this and that, from sneakers to hats\nHe said, \"Look, I'm in the mood for love\nSimply because you're near me\"\n(Let's go) To my house, lay back and get nice\nWatch television, Reunite On Ice\nI said, \"Slow down, I know you wanna shake me down\nBut I'm not one of the girls to go rippin around\"\n\n(Just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nI cram to understand you)\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nNext month I finally went to his house\nI walked into the door, there was a girl on the couch\nI said, \"Who's the frog, the bump on the log?\nYou chump, you punk, how could you do me wrong?\nSinging sad songs about your love is so strong\"\nYou said, \"Wait Lyte, you're confused, the girl is my cousin\"\nYour brother agreed, but later she said that she wasn't\n\n(Just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nI cram to understand U)\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nForgotten, next month we went to the Deuce\nWell, I thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice\nYou knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody\nAsked ya how you met em, said you met em at a party\nThen these girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff\nI said, \"It's not your business, so shut the fuck up\"\nThey said, \"Okay Lyte, think what you wanna think\nBut it's gon' be some shit when your man becomes a -\"\nI said, \"Look, to bust a move, I don't even know you\nTo put it Lyte, I really don't care to\"\nThey kinda got mad and sort of offended\nThey said, \"We only lookin out for yo best interest\"\nI said, \"Thanks but no thanks\" in an aggravated tone\n\"When I wanna find out, I find out on my own\"\n\n(Just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nI cram to understand U)\n\n[ VERSE 4 ]\nThen my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C\nWell I'm clawin my thoughts, I wonder who she could be\nYou're spending all your time with her and not a second with me\nThey say you spend your money on her and you're with her night and day\nHer name starts with a C and it ends with a k\nI strain my brain lookin for a name to fit this spellin\nBut I just couldn't do it cause my heart kept yellin\nBurning, begging for affection from you, Sam\nBut just like a test I cram to understand you\nThought I knew you well enough to call you a man\nBut (Just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nJu-just like a test\nI cram to understand you)\n\n[ VERSE 5 ]\nThen it came a time you started looking kinda thin\nI asked you why, you said, \"Exercise, tryina stay slim\"\nI bought it, even though I knew it was a lie\nCause it really didn't matter, you were still lookin fly\nBut oh no, oh no, you started askin me for money\nButter me up, beg me and call me your honey\nSo I gave you 2 yards, and then I gave you one more\nYou picked up your jacket and you flew out the door\nYou came back an hour later and you asked me for a 10\nI said, \"I only got a 20\", you said, \"Give me that, then\"\nI said, \"Nope, I'll tell you now, you better stop slobbin\nFind you a job, or you better start robbin\"\nSo I stepped off with a giant step\nPicked up my belongings, and I just left\nAnd now I see you in Empire every Sunday\nJuicin the girls up for some money and a lay\nBut every time I see you doin it, I just ruin it\nTell em how ya on crack, smoke, sniff, and chewin it\nAnd as for this girl, Miss C, oh well\nI was shocked as hell when I heard, Samuel\nWhen your homeboys told me, I almost went wack\nThat the girl you was addicted to, her name was Crack\n\n"

ANY emcee\nThat wanna gets with me\nSo yo, pack your bags, and skedaddle\nJust walk, cause you don't wanna battle\nI got the button that'll get rid of wack emcees\nIt's called the Brooklynizer, have you beggin on your knees\nSo quit takin up space on the CD rack\nYou better prepare, cause Lyte gives no slack\nInside of me, dwells a hundred maniacs\nWaitin for the kickoff, waitin for attack\nWho gives a FUCK??  Bring your posse!\nCause in the 90's, Lyte is goin kamikaze\n\n..\n\nInside -- there's no flipside\nOutside there's more than meets the eye\nSo now you know, not because you're guessin\nBut because I told you so, I never fess\nEveryone wants to rap, what's this a wagon?\nBring your band and hop and start draggin\nAll you rappers, you're fuckin impersonators\nSayin I'll rap now, and learn how to rap later\nNo time for that, time is too short\nAnd the rappin gift it can not be bought\nA solo artist - HAH, you can't be\nMaybe you'll look BETTER with a posse\nBut all that you're talkin, you ain't sayin shit!\nSo why you where you at?  I think you oughta quit\nPosses don't MATTER in the 90's\nHere's a warning -- Lyte is goin kamikaze!\n\n"

Is this what the whole thing has came to be?\nSometimes I feel like a space you're caught in between or I might not be the person that you thought you seen\nSee it's something about the truth I learned to accept it.  I tried to hide my heart but you found where I kept it\nThe heart sees thing the eyes don't catch. Pitch my heart like a bone then you tell me to fetch\nIt gets to the point and how you love to show that so you think you know it all nah, but i know that\nPlenty of time you threaten i'm going. That's right i'm making like the wind and I'm blowing\nYou just my sweetheart and I don't doubt you but first let me tell you\n\nChorus\nHow I feel about You...How I feel about You...how I feel about you... How I feel about youuuuuu\n\nSecond verse(MC SHAN)\n\nLet me tell you're my heart we go arm in arm, and I always said you had that old persuasive charm\nAnd when we kiss forget firecrackers try a grenade, when it comes to loving me babe you mastered the trade\nWhat boggles me most is why you're so suspicious of me. And all the time you tell me that you love me\nYou know the lines the famous ones that left many strung out just like nameless sons\nBut every time say it, it gets twisted and dented, but one things' for sure I know that I meant it\nAnd when I come home I get \"where you been what you been doing? And don't let me find out you been screwing.\"\nGoddamn I was chilling with the fellas and your nosy girl says \"yeah sure you was tell us\"\nOnce again you said i'm leaving i'm going that's right I'm making like the wind and I'm blowing\nYou just might sweetheart and I don't doubt you, but first let me tell you\n\nChorus\nHow I feel about you...how I feel about you...how I feel about youuuu...how I feel about you...How I feel about You...How I feel about You...How, how,how..how, how, how, how\n\nThird verse(MC SHAN)\n\nCome to think about it you being tired of me you try to denounce everything that I try to be\nLet's refocus, fix the frame and by the way to think about it I'm glad you came\nBust the pimple it's at it's head and how I feel about you there's more to be said\nThat time when I was rushing late for the flight, so you thought that was jetting and I was out of there right?\nI came close but luckily I missed it, waved my hands in the air and bye-bye I kissed it\nSo I returned just to surprise ya, but I was stunned I didn't realize ya had this look and I was it. I was supposed to be gone yet there was candles lit,but you being oh so smart and so witty said \"aah you missed your flight isn't that a tough titty.\"\nIt's like you knew you had the dinner fixed, putting two and two together just didn't mix\nYou got me comfy relaxed and fed me on and on and on and on you led me\nAnything I asked you just kept nodding and out of nowhere you asked \"Would I beg your pardon?\"\nAnd then suddenly the phone had clicked and something said yo you better go and answer it quick\nI heard \"i got to get off yeah i gotta to,\" \"I'm coming over\" you was smart for telling him not to\nI played it off like it was copacetic you played me good girl, i got to give you credit\nYou're free to leave now go ahead go and this is how I feel about you...HOE!\n\nChorus\n\n"

I fight for my hip-hop\nNot everybody can relate to what I been through\nEven though some front and they try to pretend to\nKnow about the life of a kid and the strife\nWhere he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe\nGood goes to bad, bad goes to worse\nAnd pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse\nSo clean out ya ears and open up your eyes\nI reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky\nMy stomach is growlin, word is born\nCos all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn\n\n[Hook]\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nAll I had for dinner was a can-o-corn\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nBefore I went to school I had a can-o-corn\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nI tried to get full off a can-o-corn\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nThat's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen\n\n[Verse 2]\nA few years later, I pledge allegiance to the set\nI'm growin up but I ain't grown yet\nIt's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain\nCan sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain\nI'm sittin in the restaurant, guardin my food like a eagle\nPickin up scraps like a seagull\nWaitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip\nSo I can put it in my pocket\nPhoney Easter Bunny,Santa Claus and the stork\nWe was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork\nAnd it ain't no motherfuckin way no how\nWhen it come up I let you bring me down\nSo I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group\nOf gangstas and hoodlums,but you can call em 'scroops'\nGive me liberty or give me death\nCos a man without pride ain't got shit left,huh\nAnd now that I'm older with kids of my own\nI put me in the pot where it used to be a bone\nGet'cha self together,word is born\nCos a man can't live on a can-o-corn\n\n"

(we smoke to the maximum)\nDoin our thing kickin' back relax and um\n\n[Chorus]\nAdi adi adi adi ah...

Better yet, make it a quarter-to.\u201d\nWell at her house I wrung the bell, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\u201cMe, Dana Dane, here to pay Kim a visit\u201d\nA faint voice said, \u201cI\u2019m back here!\u201d\nAs I bypassed the living room, straight to the rear\nNow in the bedroom on the bed she lay\nUrging me on as she began to say\n\u201cI heard you were great, by word of mouth\"\n\"But right here and now I\u2019m going to wear you out\u201d\nI threw my arms in the air, said \u201cIt\u2019s out of my hands.\u201d\nI took off my shirt and dropped my pants\nThen with a grin and before I jumped in\nAnd I swam and I swam like a happy dolphin\nI hit at all angles, the bottom, the top\nThen she screamed out, \u201cDane, stop!\u201d\nI knew she seemed to (be) singing a new tune\nExhausted, she slowly went to the bathroom\nThen a moment later she was back ready?!\n\u201cExcuse me lover boy, ready for round two?\u201d\nFor four or five rounds now this went on\nSomething was wrong\nCause I was getting worn\nSo I followed to the bathroom to scope the deal\nYo, it couldn\u2019t be, it can\u2019t be real\nNow check this out y\u2019all\nWould you believe, Kim was just one of the beautiful three?\nBut now that I had met the whole gang\nThree on one? But it ain\u2019t no thing\nYou think that tale\u2019s too tall or maybe I lied?\nBut anything can happen in Tales from the Dane Side?\n\n[Verse 2]\nLate one night walking through a park\nGosh, I must admit it was awfully dark\nNow me and this kid, he didn\u2019t pay me no mind\nHe was stepping kind of fast, I guess he had to make time\nA hood on his head, couldn\u2019t see his face\nBut by the way that he walked, well I assumed he was gay\nHe dipped out (of) the park and I knew he was gone\nBut wait, pointed at my head was this .45 long\nIt was the kid, came back for me\nHe said, \u201cTake off your coat and all your jewelry\u201d\nOther than the fact I was about to be taxed\nSomething in this guy\u2019s voice made me, um, relax\nPlaying with my coat, trying to stall for time\nHe knew I was trying to play with his mind\nHe started getting confused like a young boy would\nHe made a frantic mistake and took off his hood\nAstonished, amazed, my face turned pale\nWould you believe this guy was a sweet female?\nShe said, \u201cWant everything that you\u2019ve got on\nI even want your BVD nylons\u201d\n\u201cNow BVDs,\u201d I said, \u201care well and fine\u201d\n\u201cBut the Dane here only wears Calvin Klein.\u201d\nShe changed. My name must have struck a nerve\n\u201cAre you the rapper Dana Dane? You can\u2019t be, word\u201d\nShe said, \u201cYou\u2019re the best. You\u2019re number one\u201d\nSmiling, blushing, waving the gun\nWord to the parent, I gotta get some\nAs she pulled out a pack of lubricated condoms\nForced me to take of my fly [?] [?]\nWe proceeded to christen an old park bench\nSome might disbelieve and say I lied\nBut anything can happen in Tales from the Dane Side\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I went to a party, go cool and hard\nGirlies calling out my name like I\u2019m a superstar\nScreaming out of their heads\nGoing out of their minds\nSaying, \u201cOh, Dana Dane, you\u2019re so divine!\u201d\nNow the night was still early, about an hour until twelve\nWhen up jumps this figure from the depths of hell\nHe introduced himself, \u201cLUCIFER THE GREAT\u201d\nHe said he\u2019d have my soul and he was so convinced\nHis eyes on fire\nHis voice cold\nA wave of his hand appeared a mic of gold\nNow with the same chill voice from him I was told\n\u201cI\u2019ll wager this mic against your soul\u201d\nNow the wage was this, who could rock the mic?\nWho could make the party pump for the rest of the night?\nThe mic must have made me outright possessed\nBecause I didn\u2019t hesitate and took his bet\nNow to bet against the devil is a sure enough sin\nAnd everybody knows you just can\u2019t win\nThe girls knew the deal. They cried out my name\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t take the rapper Dana Dane!\u201d\nNow the devil, he laughed, he thought he\u2019d won\nBut he didn\u2019t know the battle had just begun\nCause I kicked him this rhyme, yes smooth and on tempo\nHe tried the same, but a real lame attempt though\nHe bowed his head and said, \u201cI lose\u201d\nThen laid the golden mic by my Bally shoes\nSo I slapped him across the head and said, \u201cfor shame, for shame\u201d\nNow right before eyes, yo, the devil changed\nNow laughing at me with these rotten teeth\nYeah, you guessed it, Anita The Beast\nNow some might disbelieve and say I lied\nBut anything can happen in Tales from the Dane Side\n\n"
