The\nGunplay allegedly stems from an ungoing feud... both artists claim no\nInvolvement in the incident. No arrests have yet been made in\nConnection with the shooting.\"\n\n\"In other news, rap artist Foxy Brown was hospitalized yesterday after\nAn apparent overdose on a common prescription drug. While the overdose\nWas allegedly an atempt at her own life, no one from the hospital nor\nFoxy's family were available for comment. Stay tuned for more news\"\n\n\"Inga Marchand, also known as rapper Foxy Brown, was taken to a local\nHospital today, when the Range Rover she was driving spun out of\nControl at a Brooklyn sidestreet.

I'm blowing a ten\nBecause Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison\nI'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps\nI'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack\nNow every morning's a fast start\nBut it ain't a problem getting dressed\nBecause my closet got more aisles than Pathmark\nRun when we starting a raid\nOr leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs\nI'm a young pimp, pardon my age\nI don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids\nNiggas find out what club they at, take them with us\nAnd run trains on them, like a subway map\nYour advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels\nGot most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper\nI go to college on the tour\nI'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur\nKeep your ammo clean, Tech's polished in the drawer\nCamera's by the hampers that monitor the floor\nBy now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery\nFlashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me\nBurglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy\nWhite T: burgundy, you match now, back down\nNiggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear\nCatch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear\nHeavy when I tote, C-notes from different years\nBezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs\nYou ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya\nI send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher\nYou better off with the stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive\nYou ain't gettin' nuttin', but you french fries supersized\nIt's a damn shame y'all still local\nI'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga\n\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nYou still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere\nYou going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life\nAnd your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you\nSomething positive, alright:\nWell, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;\nYou ain't going nowhere\nGet yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}\nFucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}\n\n"

to do nothin'\nSo I'mma go buy this pack, of 100's\nTake me about 10 minutes to smoke a whole 100\nYeah, I'mma snip one upside down\nAnd I'mma take one out and I'mma light it...\n\nJust give me 10 minutes\nI just need 10 minutes alone\nTo not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone\nJust to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets\nJust let me smoke this one cig in peace\nGive me 10 minutes\nWithout y'all comin at me with that bull\nSometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull\nAnd right now, that's what got the kid at peace\nLet me smoke this one cig in peace\n\nLook, now 'is a couple dudes that don't wanna see me poppin'\nThey sarcastically ask me 'when your CD's droppin'\nGotta keep my game face\nThey don't leave me no options\nCan't lose my cool I know the streets keep watchin'\nDudes wanna see me lose it all\nBut I ain't come this far to fall\nLet me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all\nI ain't come this far to fall\nAnd I ain't gotta walk around with my clip and nine\nA real nigga just open his coat to me and said his is mine\nHe said call him with his problems\nBut he don't know that there's always problems, it only gets worse\nLike, some dudes get threatened they can't stop me\nSo all they do is threaten to pop me\nBut go and get your weapon and cock, G\nSee it's real here, I dun been up and down the block all week and I'm still here\nLook, you wanna know where the booze and coke at\nGangsta's, gorillas, damoo's and locs at\nWhere the bricks, where the dip, where the X, where the morphine be\nTake the turnpike to 14B\nBut now it's back to this pussy dude threatenin' to hurt me\nI didn't know all of this came with reppin' Jersey\nBut now it's no secret\nIf the thought of jump off doin it makes you so heated nigga so be it\nBut certain beef will be handeled if you're special\nOnly marble in the crib, is the handle on the special\nMy guns in the hood\nI can't run from the hood\nNigga my sons in the hood\nThat should tell you what's what\nSoon as I feel good you retards remind me\nBut son, it ain't hard to find me\nI'm at ringside any time the fights on\nAnd I'm in the big black truck with the Carolina lights on\nOr you can hop on the Pulaski Skyway\nI'm in the strip club almost every Friday\nKats is cornballs\nY'all dudes is bitches\nLike I ain't got enough problems with this music business\n\nJust give me 10 minutes\nI just need 10 minutes alone\nTo not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone\nJust to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets\nJust let me smoke this one cig in peace\nGive me 10

I don't wanna be bothered\nSome days I just miss my father (damn)\nSome days I just miss my father\nSome days I wanna relapse on redline\nCuz he'll be gone for 26 months fed time\nI try to maintain through all this\nAnd pray to god pop keep the same clean date in Fort Dix\nMy pockets flat kid\nYou do the math on $5.15 an hour full time after taxes\nThat wasn't good enough to keep my MO\nShit that wasn't good enough to complete my demo, for real\nSome days I don't wanna be seen\nAnd some days I don't shower, I don't wanna be clean\nLook, sometimes the truth could hurt you\nSo I blow my cig smoke right at the Truth commercial\nSome days I don't wanna be bothered\nSome days I just miss my father\nAnd even if by a miracle he makes it half way out\nIt won't be parole y'all, it be the half way house but NAH\nThat's not the right path for a Budden\nCuz we're addicts, addicts can't do half of nothin'\nSome days I'm reachin for the thing in the dresser\nSome days I'm not invincible and I feel the pressure\nLike if everyone's dependin on me, and I just stop\n...\nThen what the fuck happens?\nI can't take that route and girl out\nAnd sometimes I don't wanna hear my girls mouth cause\nMy hectic schedule, she ain't considering\nSo all I hear is the complaints and bickerin\nRadio's, studio's, photo shoot's\nShe think I'm fuckin every girl that say I'm oh so cute, cute\nDon't appreciate a man and you lose him\nWorst thing to do to an innocent man is accuse him\nAnd I ain't with beefin' with home's\nBrand Nubian style, I had to love ma' but leave her alone\nIt ain't workin out, I'll see you aight\nJust let go and let God see if we reunite\nCuz with yo shit added to the dudes that wanna see me fall\nNah, fuck it I won't fall\nLet me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all\nI ain't come this far to fall, fall\nBut listen, I'm fucked up now\nDon't ask why y'all\nSometimes the best medicine is just to cry y'all\nKnow what I'm sayin?\nExcuse my voice fans, that should be a sign that I identify with what I'm sayin\nCuz it's these type of thoughts that'll kill ya\nIf you smokin' with me right now, then you a good way from the filter\nAnd I won't front like I ain't stressin'\nSometimes I need a hug, real shit, pain shared is pain lessened (nigga)\n\nJust give me 10 minutes\nI just need 10 minutes alone\nTo not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone\nJust to

sparked when the song was beginnin at that time\nThen your stoge should be endin with mine\nAnd to you know who...\nMa, I never saw me being with you\nBut sometimes y'all dreams come true\nI'm like your number one fan\nDamn, I ain't think Joe would see you\nYou's a fantasy\nI wasn't supposed to meet you, NAH\nChances of that were so unlikely\nAnd if we did meet, you wasn't supposed to like me\nBut look, I rap now and it just so happens\nGod put me in a spot where that was just so happenin, see\nShe had a man, I had a girl\nI broke up with mine and around that same time\nWe was hangin out she never laid a hand on me\nBut I could tell from the way she glanced at me\nHer looks said baby boy somethin hampers me\nAnd it would go down but I got my man with me\nLord how can it be?\nYou know I never been the dude to come and break up a happy family\nAnd these 2 looked so happy on the outside\nThey could've only been happy on the outside\nWe eventually started creepin'\nBut for me it's just sex\nFor her it's cheatin'\nIt went down, one time, two times, once more\nTalkin real passionate, every time it jumped off\nI'm in deep y'all she's more than a jump off\nWe both catchin' feelins, both startin to want more\nBut guess what, she can't leave him\nMaybe it's somethin' I don't know about, maybe she needs him\nMeans I still gotta front like we ain't sleepin'\nStill gotta shake his hand, I still gotta see him\nHow's he supposed to look, supposed to feel for me\nHe gotta know I'm feelin you, and you feelin me\nHow am I supposed to look at that man with respect\nWith Bleek singin 'Is That Your Chick In My Head'\nDru Hill - 'Somebody Sleepin In My Bed'\nAaliyah - 'If Your Girl Only Knew' reversed, but look\nHere's why I'm down and out\nI'm kinda worried y'all\nI ain't heard from him much since he found out\nEven if she wasn't mine y'all, she's still in the brain\nAnd I know wherever she's at, she's feelin' the same\nSo 'till my fantasy dame pop up\nEverytime the cell rings I'm prayin that her name pop up, for real\nI know y'all, I ain't supposed to wife her\nBut it's God's fault, I wasn't supposed to like her\nSometimes I think, why'd I have to meet chick for?\nAnd some times dog, be careful what you wish for\nSome times I don't wanna be bothered\nSome days I just miss my father\nHe's stuck in the system\nTreated like a dude that's heartless\nAnd they just transfered him, brought him up on new charges\nYeah folks I'm back to that\nSo I light another one and smoke back to back for real\nI'm chain smokin' if you ain't on my page, listen\nI'm stressed out, hopin' this one'll taste different\nDudes hopin' that I lose it all\nI ain't come this far to fall\nLet me talk to all of you dudes wishin that I lose it all\nI ain't come this far to fall\n\nNah, I won't fall\nHopin that I lose it all\nI won't fall, nigga (nah)\nHopin that I lose it all\nI ain't come this far to fall\nNah\nNah, (ain't come this)\nSome days I don't wanna be bothered\nSome days I just miss my father (damn)\n\nJust give me 10 minutes\nI just need 10 minutes alone\nTo not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone\nJust to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets\nJust let me smoke this one cig in peace\nGive me 10 minutes\nWithout y'all comin at me with that bull\nSometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull\nAnd right now, that's what got the kid at peace\nLet me smoke this one cig in peace (peace, peace)\n\n"

That's right, baby\n'Cause I'm ill like a sick metaphor\nGot the crowd chanting \"Cena\" like they want some more\nYo, hand in front of my face, \"you can't see me\"\nYou probably heard me rip MC's on 92.3\nThat's right, hold up your hands, wave 'em high\nThat was a nice diss but it was a wack ass try\nYou can't fly with me, C-E-N-A\nIt's a freestyle rap, baby, we don't play\nI come off the dome like every day\nCome at you from both sides like lesbian three ways\nWhat up?!\n\n"

Who doesn't have a lot of money\nBut you have a little money, and when you get that little money...\nYou spend that shit\n\nI work hard for my money, so hard for the money\nEvery time I get a little, I'm gon' spend it like a dummy\nIf my money was a NBA team and I was the head coach of the squad\nI'd be Jeff Van Gundy, wastin' all of my funding\nMy wallet stays hungry\nMad like Pooh with the pot and no honey\nMoney wouldn't be funny if I stuck to my budget, but my motto is \"fuck it\"\nBuy now, cry later, hopin that everything works out in my favor\nI keep my receipt should I seek a release\nFrom this contract of commerce, speakin of which\nI'm the most at ease when I'm spending my grip\nBut don't trip, I'm a retail slut\nStimulatin the economy so I can get fucked\nWhen I go out shoppin, I go for broke\nI mean literally, there is no hope\n\nCause I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit\nPut it in the bag soon as I eye that shit\nMy pockets so broke, about to cry and shit\nBut do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)\nI'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit\nPut it in the bag soon as I eye that shit\nMy pockets so broke, about to cry and shit\nBut do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)\n\nDecember 23. 2002\nAround midnight, where were you?\nMe, I was out for them Episode 2 Star Wars action figures\n(Wait, back up my nigga, you can't mean toys?)\nHell yeah fool, me and a hundred white boys\nWe was waitin in line\nSome buy to collect, some to sell online\n(Man, hold up, you can't rhyme line with line)\nMan, that's not the point\nI spent two hundred plus before I even left the joint\nIf my mama only knew\nI was out droppin notes when I owe her a few\nMy ass'd be through, You wouldn't be hearing this song today\nCan you say, buyers remorse\nNow I'm prayin that my CD's sellin out in the stores\nCause I hate being poor\nI may have dropped a couple hundred but I'm one with the Force\n\nAnd I'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit\nPut it in the bag soon as I eye that shit\nMy pockets so broke, about to cry and shit\nBut do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)\nI'm a big time spender, let me buy that shit\nPut it in the bag soon as I eye that shit\nMy pockets so broke, about to cry and shit\nBut do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast (It's just not fair)\n\nI mean, it comes and it goes, making funds from shows\nThe next day I'm at the mall buying tons of clothes\nEve though I get free shit, hella LRG shit\nI'm calling El-P: Quick! Send me some loot\nI'm over budget, I'm recordin (??)\nWhen that check comes, I hit the swap meet and I buy some new Jordans\nI'm often at Slauson, trickin of my chips of\nBootleg movies and, brand new kicks\nI'm scan-da-lous, but I just can't help it\nCall me what you want just, don't call me selfish\nAlways think of others, moms and my little brother\nIt's the thought that counts, so I keep'em in mind\nAs long as they stay out of my pockets, that's fine\nAs for my girl? Shit, what can I say?\nBought her a rice cooker and some lingere\nI know it's for my benefit, but that's how it is\nWhen you\n\nBig time spendin, let me buy that shit\nPut it in the bag soon as I eye that shit\nMy pockets so broke, about to cry and shit\nBut do you think I care, it comes slow and goes fast\nAnd it's just not fair, BT$\n\nBorn to shop\n\nBuy that shit\n\nBig time spenders\n\nEli ??\n\n{?}\n\nAnd Nick Carter\n\n'Bout to buy everything in your fucking local mall\n\nGet it out\n\nBetter tell somebodyyyy {*fades out*}\n\n"

Wild\nBut when you start to bubble then your friends they spite you\nAnd if you go to church, then hip-hop won't like you\nI feel like a giant on a worldwide stage\nBut at the same time trapped in a real tight cage\nWith no way out, I play out, then I come back\nCause there's an unwritten law that says I can't be wack\nSo I put on my game face, go back to the same place\nOnly to realize that y'all ain't got the same taste\nEven with somethin new, they look at you cold\nAnd without a hot face, consider you old\nAnd leavin me stressed and broken-hearted\nHow could I be finished with West coast rap? I helped start it!\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

pledge\nI wanna know myself\nSorta solo sheep amidst wolves\nAnd still my shepherd can't administer\nThe proper push and pulls\nI push the ghouls to man overboard\nPull the bulls onto my sword\nAnd buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor\nGot an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar\nGot a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over\nThe recipe's designed to plug the appetite for continuity\nBy stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully)\nI peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers\nCauterize the wound and heads like\n\"Gimme gimme something major\"\nRoad side prophetic, ascend well (well)\nEnveloped in a mummy ribbon system\nBlistering in a wishing well\nBIG BANG!\n\n"

Right\nI irrigate it straight to mainline\nYou want to do the same? Fine\nThese pretty profit grommet teams solidify to clot the slippery city sump piston pump drain\nBehold \"Old King Credible\". Kind soul with a Russian-roulette bad mood spin-off\nWhere every day, a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers\nOne sixth buckle\nFive sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle\nBut I'll get you (I'mma get at you)\nMy novelty, wobbly rope bridge broke inches prior to dry land\nBut duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix down well\nWell, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid\nI'll be the cat with guilty look on face and shirt that reads, \"I didn't do it\"\nGod, is it on? Is it beyond basic?\nDoes it ice-grill you? Or is every song faceless?\nDoes it have a title? If it didn't would you name it?\nDoes it babble about nothing like a drunk atheist?\nWe could run that Orwell's '84 warp for the Room 101 detour\nUntil each client fidgets with his or her own worst fear specifics\nSwerve around the cobra kisses\nSee if the venom overloads this vision, I'mma suck the poison out and spit it\nStole my sneakers but your feet just never fit in\nServes you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits\nI'mma tiptoe across this yo-yo string\nUntil you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down\n\n[Hook]\nIt goes boom boom boom (x4)\nBoombox (x4)\nC'mon\n\n[Sample: C-Rayz Walz]\nI originate with the drums\n\n[Verse 2]\nEarth to A.R. vertical\nBurden has increased at an alarming rate\nBliss is down a point, murder up, glee down, and still falling\nStill crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays came this blind soldier-burning confessional\nEase back, let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10\nLet the back burner boiling point descend\nI race the derby in the first heat (strike personal)\nStrike personal space with a most utterly putrid version of grace\nSpit the gimmick, sit and fidget wild\nIn five you'll be jumping through hoops like Coney Island freak show midgets\nWant to be a fighter pilot?\nDriving that childish early Wright Brothers experiment prototypic model fossil\nSitting sweating bullets on a console\nBusting accidental dirt bike donuts outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo\nDead before the chubby debutante conquered the high note\nSchooled by the cruel intention invention's pensive sideshow\nSee contrary to popular certainty, I alone advance\nWithout an earthly poem, and dance on a handful of zoning fans\nCombing every chance to own the land, I roam with dome in hand\nAnd truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap\nSee I convince myself it's on, therefore it is\nAnd the melody settles beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids\nI tried to get 'em all open, and once I quit and said I didn't care\nThat's when they all threw their hands in the air\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

Must warn others\nTrust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers\nI milk my habitat for almost everything I want\nSometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut\nMust not sleep. Must warn others\nTrust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers\nI'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine\nBut it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning\n\n[Verse 2]\nCrowning the glory of our advance\nFire ants to water beetles\nThese Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles\nPupil turned pedagogue, benediction to my dream\nBeaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine\nCheck it\nI'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time\nGripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline\nIt's a metaphor for nighttime\nAnti-up the slight cost of exhaustion\nTo salute the moon above paradise lost and you're a spectator, stringent\nInch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul\n(You should know!)\nBurrow up through the dirt with bloody digit\nLick my knuckles clean\nNoting the corporate clusters holding hands\n'round the abode of the damned\nNow what's your poison?\nStarlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser\nSip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later:\nThe eyelids pivot back upon the hinges\n20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by\nNow I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline\nWith no free time. The alarm storms at nine\nMy daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir\nSir, do you mind if I breathe, sir?\nOh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.'\nI breathe slow\nI run in with these fantastic amalgams\nPainting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums\nSecurity's the javelin, catch it\nLabor\nClocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever since\n\n[Hook]\nMust not sleep. Must warn others\nTrust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers\nI milk my habitat for almost everything I want\nSometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut\nMust not sleep. Must warn others\nTrust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers\nI'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine\nBut it's ridiculous at times.

stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville\nIf my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell it was just sundown in small white town\nThey call it East Side Palmdale\nWhen the afroman walked through the white land\nHouses went up for sale\nWell I was standing on the corner sellin' rap cds\nWhen I met a little girl named Jan\nI let her ride in my Caddy\nBecause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan\nWe fucked on the bed\nFucked on the floor\nFucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro\nThen I fucked to the left (left)\nFucked to the right (right)\nShe sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white\nThought to myself sheeba-sheeba\nGot my ass lookin' like a zebra\nI put on my clothes and I was on my way\nUntil her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet\nAnd so I ran I jumped out the back window\nBut her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four\nOh, he beat me to the left\nHe beat me to the right\nThe motherfucker whooped my ass all night\nBut I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad\nThat's the best damn pussy I ever had\nGot a bag of weed and a bottle of wine\nI'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time\n\n[Hook]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our

Hollywood\nShe had green hair but damn she looked good\nI took her to my house because she was fine\nBut she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine\nI met this lady from Japan\nNever made love with an African\nI fucked her once, I fucked her twice\nI ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice\nDon't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)\nI met a woman in the heart of Australia\nHad a big butt and big titties too\nSo I hopped in her ass like Kangaroo\nSee I met this woman from Hawaii\nStuck it in her ass and she said \"AIEE\"\nLips was breakfast, pussy was lunch\nThen her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch\nI met Colonel Sanders wife in the state of Kentucky\nShe said I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me\nI came in her mouth, it was a crisis\nI gave her my secret blend of Herbs' n' Spices\n\n[Hook]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin'

again\nMet a real black girl down in South Carolina\nFucked her until she turned into a white albino\nFucked this hooker in Iowa\nI fucked her on credit, so I owe her\nFucked this girl down in Georgia\nCame in her mouth, man I thought I told ya\nMet this beautiful sexy ho\nShe just ran across the border of Mexico\nFine young thing said her name's Maria\nI wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla\nI wanna get married but I can't afford it\nI know I'm'a cry when she get deported\n\n[Hook]\nColt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that

went over a girl's house to fuck\nBut the pussy just ain't no good\nI mean you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet\nPlus you in the wrong neighborhood\nSo you try to play it off and eat the pussy\nBut it take her so long to cum\nThen a dude walk in, that's her big boyfriend\nAnd he asks you where you from\nSo you wipe your mouth and you try to explain\nYou start talking real fast\nBut he already mad cause you fucking his woman\nSo he start beating on you ass\nNow your clothes all muddy\nYour nose all bloody\nYour dick was hard but now it's soft\nYou thought you had a girl to rock your world\nNow you still gotta go jack off\n\n[Hook]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\n\n"

wintertime\nDiminishin' limits defined the minute I finish the rhyme\nExhibiting sickness inside, cats are scared as hell\nI spit with gymness fit, and no bars are parallel\nMy service is removin' cervixes for the head of worthless gimmicks\nOnly sound you just make is pissin' in a lake from nervousness\nI [?] swallow fuels, right through some hollow tunes\nAnd burn you so black, your shadow won't even follow you\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

How did she break it down?\nMan, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down, that's your child\nBut if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheating\nAnd you went raw dog when you beat it\nThat's when she gon' tell you to beat it\nAnd you know it ain't y'all little secret\nYou famous, you can't go nowhere\n'Cause everytime you go there, there's hoes there\nSo basically, you and your girl over\nAnd I know when she broke the news\nYou told her, \"Man, don't say that\"\nMatter fact, like Pat, don't say jack\nEverytime a nigga sitting on pay stacks\nThings come up from way, way, way back\nWay back, way back\nWay, way back, way back\n\n[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]\nThese are my confessions\nJust when I thought I said all I can say\nMy chick on the side said she got one on the way (rock with me)\nThese are my confessions\nMan I'm throwed and I don't know what to do\nI guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions\nIf I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)\nDamn near cried when I got that phone call (call)\nI'm so throwed, I don't know what to do\nBut to give part two of my confessions\n\n[Outro: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]\nThis by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do (yeah)\nTo tell you, the woman I love (uh huh)\nThat I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know (yeah)\nI hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this (she probably can't)\nAnd hopefully you'll give me another chance (she might go)\n\n"

You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now, do you? They will go through bone like butter\n\n"

Till we get a equal cut\nWe come through straight smashin on the haters\nWitness the world, the Rhymesayers\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOften the brain runs\nAnd expresses itself in words, sometimes profane ones\nThat's when it first occurred to me where the pain comes\nFrom, page one in my rhyme book\nIf you listen closely you can picture how my line looks\nYou presently pressed to be restin next to me\nThe best of me molestin destiny wrestlin with ecstacy\nThe recipe for immoratlity\nFlows actually be on the malls and factories\nOf urban life with the laws of gravity\nAudacity, you got a lot of it\nCommon sense should tell you not to rap against\nMy obvious dominance\nMy real life size is bigger than your confidence\nMan, fuck ya'll\n\n[ Hook ]\n\n"

    "lyrics": "\n\n[Bubba Sparxxx]\nOkay\nIf you shed blood with me to this point, you deserve an explanation\nFor all the hell you've endured, while helping me reach my destination\nAnd this effort to bless the nation\nI've might had did more harm than good\nBut I've always showed you heart, this is just my but apart from would\nMan I love the darkest hood\nBut also the brightest suburb\nTo think I would just despise the folks because I'm broke and white it's absurd\nI'm told be tight you get heard, but I don't hear my vinyl spinning\nYeah we found some distribution, but bet the crying is just beginning\nCause these bright nights, could lead to dark days and vice versa\nEven if Greg Street don't play, I guarantee you a nice purchase\nFrankly, I'm quite certain I'm the livest fucker out there\nI'm making love to the truth, inside that vocal booth without care\nI won't even talk about stares\nFrom angry illogic rappers\nCause every time they get confronted, they'll give you head than dap ya\nThis one don't really need a hook, but Shannon said it'll be a single\nSo I devote this to my life, so much more than a catch of a jiggle\n\n[Hook]\nDark days, bright nights\nFor that outside in the night, you know what Bubba's life is like\nBright nights, dark days\nFor them broads that truly love me and hate to see me live this way\nDark days, bright nights\nFor when they say you can't live, fuck 'em, do it just out of spite\nBright nights, dark days\nFor every person without a voice that got something they need to say\n\n[Bubba Sparxxx]\nSee it's imperative that you know, there's a lot of folks that love Bubba\nNot cause of any rap I wrote, they see something above gutter\nThough, my pockets don't reflect that\nIt's my vision, and they respect that\nLove comes in a form of a various drug, and I can't neglect that\nSo me and my folks get fucked up like six nights out of seven\nThat's the bright light of our lives\nLike God's shinning light right out of Heaven\nBut at the conclusion of every session\nI wish that Dark Day to expose\nThe plight of my situation, no blow, no dough for big shows\nBut still they see we this close from seeing the promise land\nSo that leads to another bright night, when all of us is college grads\nBeing loved by the moms and dads\nWhich some of us wasn't blessed with\nYou think we all born with two lovin' parents and a treasure chest\nShit, I was fortunate to be loved, by my paternal units\nI'm gonna make their son a winner, fuck how bad it'll hurt I'm doing it\nEven if I was to ruin it\nNever with me and my heart part ways\nWe developed too strong of a bond, turning bright nights into dark days\n\n[Hook]\n\nYeah it's true, I also do get praise from the other side of the tracks\nYou know, that dark days part of town, when they intentionally hide the blacks\nAin't got no reply to that, I said I'm sorry if I'm to blame\nI tried like hell to sooth your soul by planting the facts inside your brain\nI never once lied to the game, the acceptance of not one black dude\nIt's just Bubba that country fucker smoking swages and eating snack foods\nNow every time they ask you, \"why you live the way you choose too?\"\nSay cause Bubba set you right, the only one they loved, knew you\nThat leaves you with no excuse to settle with what they offer\nHe try to pay you the slave wagers, play that role, and tell 'em naw, sir\nI'll probably won't even fault you dismiss me as the demon\nIt is true, I am not you, my skin's the tone of piss and semen\nBut if we fight this evening, I assure you, we'll both bleed red\nAnd it'll take your whole slum and all your guns to leave me dead\nPlus all that blood we shed what do nothin' but server their purpose\nSo let's unite these bright nights and dark days, then see who nervous\n\n[Hook] {*Fades to the end*}\n\n"

We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?\n\n[Verse Two]\nI knew she was different, a very special gal\nFor the time being, hmm I shall\nRespect her wishes, she wasn't a groupie\nI understand, she said she just had met me\nI liked her for that, a woman with morals\nShe called me every day, so I saw she was loyal\nIt bugged me out cause I don't usually wait\nBut on a scale of one to ten she was a twenty-eight\nWe was goin out on the reg', movies and dinner\nAlways stay at my house, way past ten o', clock\nI thought she really really liked me\nI did the right thing, like my name was Spike Lee\nShe had her own car so I walked her to the door\nLike Busta Rhymes I said, \"Gimme Some More\"\nSo I put my lips out, to get a kiss\nAnd she said just like this\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nI knew somethin was wrong because my mack is correct\nTalkin for six months and didn't hit it yet?\nI thought I was slippin, or maybe in a slump\nI felt like Eddie Murphy when he was Professor Klump\nNaw it can't be, she's here every day\nSo I don't know why she'd wanna treat me this way\nI gotta investigate like Magnum P.I\nI just don't understand, why oh why\nSo the next time I saw her she was unhappy\nShe had a frown on her face and real jumpy\nI said, \"Yo what's wrong?\"  I was real concerned\nThe way she looked her life had took a real turn\nShe said, \"I went to court today,\" and I said, \"What?\"\n\"If I tell you this, you're gonna go nut\"\nI said, \"Tell me I can take it I won't pretend\"\n\"I gotta go to jail for life, so..\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n"

Some played you out\nWhy you didn't answer back correctly, fuck was that about?\"\nAs I sip on some Henny, and try to explain some things\nAbout the life of a legend, and all the drama it brings\nBeen gone a long time, had a lot of shit on my mind\nI decided I don't want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine\nStreets is hip-hop and I'm hip-hop, so the streets is mine\nBallin' as long as you been livin', that's a long time\nHard to stay hungry when your pockets are so fat\nYou hit a hot one in every city on the map\nAnd niggas keep sleepin' and you keep coming back\nYou know better than the gat, but niggas still wanna clap\n\n[Chorus: Ja Rule]\nIt feels so good to be back where I belong\nThe streets is where I belong\nThey had me locked down much too long\nHey hey\nIt feels so good to be back where I belong\nThe streets is where I belong\nThey had me locked down much too long\nHey\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nSome say, \"L that's cool, but see times have changed\"\nNiggas got red bandanas, and the grill in the range\nThat gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains\nTrade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne\nHustling niggas found they way into the game\nExtorting all these so-called ballers with big names\nAnd you gotta have a squad, 'cause running from Def ain't safe\nI know you living good, but ain't no smile up on our face\nI'm like a villain, I'm representing on my lyrics\nAnd force feed the world, even if they don't want to hear it\nAs far as Canibus go, my man is hittin' his ex-broad\nI'm getting head from his new piece\nWhile 20 gang-bangers applaud, you came up with that bullshit\nSome heads sucked it up, then you dropped that garbage album\nAnd totally fucked it up, I coulda told ya I knew your moms\nFrom the after-hours spot, when I used to be up in Canada\nWith the dreads on a black block, before you dick rode Lost Boyz\nFor a ticket our to Jersey, but being the man I am\nI tried to show ya mercy, I coulda told the World\nThe way ya label hates your guts\nAnd how me and Wyclef, got together to set you up\nAnd how he gave me half your budget, don't believe me look it up\nYa A&R promotion niggas, they helped me hook it up\nI hate to be responsible, for destroying your career\nA one-hit wonder, huh\nNo wonder you disappeared, I coulda told the world\nYou get your lyrics from the internet\nThen spit 'em word for word\nLike you really a rap vet, How you take metaphors from books\nAnd put 'em in your rhyme, and how you really from Canada\nAnd you been frontin' all this time\nI heard your second album, that shit is garbage too\nLL Cool J and I did this to you\nOn that note he said\n\"Yo L, you the man\", I said peace, one love\nAnd drove off in the Lex Land\n\n[Chorus: Ja Rule]\nIt feels so good to be back where I belong\nThe streets is where I belong\nThey had me locked down much too long\nHey hey\nIt feels so good to be back where I belong\nThe streets is where I belong\nThey had me locked down much too long\nHey\n\n[Outro: LL Cool J]\nYea nigga, the jig is up nigga, huh ha\nYou know what I'm sayin'? All that bullshit you was talking\nDon't mean shit, you finish now\nI'm still the man nigga\nThe vanguard award is in my motherfuckin' living room\nYou know what I mean? come get that shit, fuck, what\nMIC still on my arm nigga, word up\nBoth arms, I'ma get another one nigga\nYou Know what I'm sayin', this LL you know how I get down\nYou should of known, when you did it\nHe probably did it to get some fame\nBut is this really what you want?

Sorry if I'm homie\nLet'em know we don't play on the Eastside\nBut Dogg what's happenin' with these broads talking about bills, bills, bills\nCallin us grugs and all that homie\n\n(Snoop)\nHoney child you need to chizill\nI ain't payin' your biznill, on the riznill\nNiggers out there from the L.B.C. Northside, Northside up\nAll the homies from the Westside. Westside up\nAin't no Southside Long Beach niggers\nThere's only Eastside. Eastside up... Eastsidaz\nThis is how we doing it ya'll. Dogghouse\nYou didn't know. You do now\nWe outa this biotch. You know the rest\n\n(Snoop chorus)\nWell, well ya'll push me to the limit now its time to sail\nBut when the ship sails there won't be no ho's again\nBut as for right now I like the way you sound\nCause you're putting it down\nSo all you ho's out as soon as it hits the streets\n\n"

right now\nAyo, listen to me, man, when y'all get on the bus, y'all niggas don't even sit together\nAct like y'all don't know each other, like you're undercover on the motherfuckin' bus or somethin', know what I mean?\nWhen y'all get there, hit the terminal, y'all gon' meet my man Ty gon' pick y'all up, know what I'm sayin'?\nTake y'all out to this hustlin' spot we got out there, Newton Park out on Norfolk, you know what I mean?\nMost def', most def'\nWhere the money is proper, the hustle is proper, you know what I mean?\nUh-huh, straight gangsta\nWant you to go out there, y'all handle your business, man, you know what I'm sayin'?\nAlright\nStraight like that, aight?\nOne love, man\nMon, baby\nOkay\nGet up with you, man\nCall me, call me\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, it all began like, bust it\nMy nigga City bout to bounce on a trip\nWe met some niggas with a lot of things they want em to flip\nI told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip\nTravel safe, you know that I'ma hold it down on the strip\nGood lookin', word to mother son I give you my wit\nBut when I get back, I'ma bounce straight to your crib\nOn the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound\nWit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town\nNow, three days pass I'm still on the strip\nDoin hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips\nWith little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project\nWhen police come we stick the clips in any metal object\nThrowin' a nigga on the walls and try to search me down\nI laugh knowin' that my stash'll never be found\nWell anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip\nWit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip\nMy nigga hit me with the latest, greatest\nHe told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is\nHe said he fuckin' wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is\nWhat kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz\nHow they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American\nAnd how they changed from medallions to iced out pelicans\nAnd how they stay wit four pounders\nAnd speak American to try to blend in\nLike they ain't obvious out of towners\nOkay, I've never heard of workers gettin' five G's pay\nFor trips that last for only 2-3 day\nHow these Guyanese niggas be eatin' pasta but they love zucchini\nRockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini\nThem type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em\nRockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em\nHow they rock silks and tailor made pants\nAnd get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance\nWashrags hangin from every one of our back pockets\nFrom every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it\nAnd set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential\nRock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals\nHow they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy\nAnd love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy\nAfter all of that I wanted ones\nThe way my nigga was talkin so next trip I went to bounce with son\nSo now we out of town with Guyanese cats\nUp in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats\nShit was slow until the main fiend was offed\nJust like a thief in the night\nAnd spread the word that we was back with the white\n\n[Interlude]\n\"Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door\nAnd shut the fuck up\"\n\"Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like...\"\n\"Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates\nAnd the gym star\"\n\"Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that\"\n\"Fuck this shit\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, see how we blowin' pa\nThe lookout niggas holdin' fort like they was watchtowers\nBuggin' on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours\nSo on and so on, shit is good and we eatin'\nFirst nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin'\nThe whole town, see we now own it\nCarryin' on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments\nWe stackin' cheddar now and shit is all clear\nAnd we was growin' as workin' niggas wit aspiring ideas\nWe love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit\nBut in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit\nNow these niggas was really ready to swell up\nWe decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop\nOff in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid\nWe set up shops and watched the games begin\nSo now we ballin' like a motherfucker, money was sick\nGas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick\nFuckin everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass\nTo attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast\nWe used to takin niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt\nAnd watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built\nAin't it funny how shit transpire in fact\nNot too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at\nSome niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm\nNot a problem so immediately reach for the john\nRight away the gun, bust straight lifted a nigga\nHow we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga\nWild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats\nLeavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats\nNow we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands\nBut fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans\nShit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall\nMy son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all\nWord, I started buggin' when my nigga said he feel cold\nThen I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole\nSo as we continue to radically blaze the fifth\nFlame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?\nWell we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook\nOne nigga slid and think he got off the hook\nNow let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied\nWas one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party\nHe was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes\nStupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain\nSuddenly my nigga fell to the floor\nAnd said his legs feel like them shits ain't got no feelins no more\nMore the actin' up the more the shit I felt in my gut\nThe shit was all over as soon as the director said cut\n\n[Outro]\nThat's a wrap, good actin' motherfuckers, good actin\nThat's the shit I'm talkin' about\nY'all ready to watch the playback?\nFuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers\n[Applause]\nTHE END\n\n"

I thought so, neither do I\nIts a dick between your mother's thighs divided by pi\nI'm the sickest linguistically, illicit lyrical misfit, in the business\nAnd probably in existence.

You ain't had ya fill?\nI splash ya grill, like lighter fluid at a family meal\nOr a lesbian's face with Vagisil when she bites into it (BITES what?)\nInto coochie you dyke-slut you know you like to do it\n\n{Hook}\nCoocoo-chie coocoo-chie coocoo-chie\n\"Bitches!\"\n\"Drop to your knees\"\nCoo-cooooooooochie\n\"I do more stickin' in chicken than Stove Top Stuffing\"\nCoocoo-chie coocoo-chie coocoo-chie\n\"Bitches get wet then I inspect 'em like Deck\"\nCoo-cooooooooochie\n\"I wanna get into it man, you know\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Vagina\"\n\n[Verse 2: Louis Logic]\nAlways aim for the torso that's what I learned from playing in pornos\nWhile I'm stuffing tube steak in her  cornhole\nIf I'm late for one more show cause I spend my label's paper on more hoes\nThey'll probably would take me straight to a court show\nBut instead of gettin' screwed on TV I rather fuck cuties\nUnless ofcourse Judge Judy's in the mood to eat me\nI usually use my CD to abuse the treaty\nOf sex between me and my ex and feed her spooge in 3D (ohhh)\nYou should see me when the semen's flowin' spewin' freely\nI squeeze a load in the throat till the chicken's cheeks are swollen\nCause if a beep is showin then she gets the worm\nCatchin' cock in every turn with extra sperm till the lesson's learned\nI'm less concerned with closed nails and a precious perm\nAs long as I avoid of infectious germs and her breasts are firm\nAnd when I'm tryin to fuck your chick and call a ho a slut a bitch\nIt's for kicks so it's not a sexist term\n\n\"Now what start's with the letter 'C'?\"\n\n{Hook}\n\n[Verse 3: Louis Logic]\nChicks say I'm old fashioned, I don't want a bitch stuck in the kitchen\nI wanna stuff a dick in her ass while she's touchin' her kitten\nI like to fuck and forget 'em and try a dozen positions\nThen serve the mic a sermon like rightin' smunks of religion\nI pay homage to bondage and good will with a feel\nAnd stay up in a prime just for stacks like Wilt the Stilt\nAnd in the process I like to turn women to objects\nPenthouse to hen house of birds livin' in projects\nI don't discriminate on the basis of race or the place that you stay\nThat's hardly a chick I won't inseminate\nI spread the legs of college chicks featherweights and solid chicks\nI make 'em face the snake but I never taste the bottomlips\nI poke 'em with the Obelisk and flee from the scene\nLet me explain then you'll see what I mean\nCause as much as I love pussy you can't feed it to me\nYou know why?\nI don't eat anything that bleeds for a week and don't die\n\n{Hook}\n\n"

Fresh from a court runnin from a bar tab\nDrivin drunk with car lag in need of a barf bag\nI left my smart half on the hard path to recovery\nWith hangover hovering I took a bath in the bubbly\nI woke up in the trash, cold clutchin a flask\nWith a wino askin for some from me, but there's no stuff in my stash\nI'm so stuck in a glass but insist on throwin Rollin Rocks\nShades drawn, doors closed and locked, hopin no one knocks\nI'm in a lonely spot\nNowhere, and I want some some Stoli shots\nLike I don't care if my AA sponsor knows or not\nI'll spend a week soaked in scotch on Venice Beach with the vagrants\nThen I'm... leavin for Vegas\nBut I'm penny free, and owe a lot of dough\nTo spot my landlord and old lady liks\nIt's like I said, she likes to collect, she don't babysit\n\n[Hook]\n\"When I get bent, I must represent, no question\" {*scratched*}\nI'm the lush president of the wino section\nSince you find no lessons in this lonely life, it's like... \"Shorty let me\nTell you 'bout my only vice\" {*scratched*}\n\"When I get bent, I must represent, no question\" {*scratched*}\nI been at war with lady liks and can't find no weapons\nOr find protection on my coldest nights, it's like... \"Shorty let me tell\nYou 'bout my only vice\" {*scratched*}\n\nSo basically, my drinkin schedule's 8 to 3\nBut wait and see I bet you I can make the rate increase\nUntil I start sprayin my vomit on my Old Navy fleece\nSo sayeth the logic, so say the sheep\nMy next commandment, to drink a case a piece at least\nTo set the standard, a buncha drunks that's dead from cancer\nLeave your 12 steps abandoned on the way to the bar\nA convoy that's on joy juice racin their cars\nDrinkin grain from a jar, that's moonshine to the laymen in bars\nAnd soon I'm hearin angels with harps\nPerhaps it's beepin horns and I'm crossin lanes in my car\nAnd sleepin on the job but made it so far, I'm thinkin ain't this bizarre\nIt's kinda freezin', tryna find the reason\nWhen I realized my gates were ajar\nI took the Nestea plunge straight to the tar, but never jumped\nThen I awoke in a pool of my puke where I had left my lunch\n\n[Hook]\n\"When I get bent, I must represent, no question\" {*scratched*}\nI'm the lush president of the wino section\nSince you find no lessons in this lonely life, it's like... \"Shorty let me\nTell you 'bout my only vice\" {*scratched*}\n\"When I get bent, I must represent, no question\" {*scratched*}\nI been at war with lady liks and can't find no weapons\nOr find protection on my coldest nights, it's like... \"Shorty let me tell\nYou 'bout my only vice\" {*scratched*}\n\nI was born of beer kegs in college dorms and molotov mixtures\nFists up, breakin bottles off niggas\nMake escape doin the hundred yard dash, comin from a car crash\nThat's what I call a runnin bar tab, back to the lab\nWhen an undercover car passed after my ass\nDropped to my knees and my hands in the grass\nA straight shot to the trees beside my door, but I'd forgotten my keys\nPlus I had too much brandy to last, so I hopped to my feet\nMy hands were both clasped stoppin the stream\nIf I puked the cop would probably see\nBut he was watchin me flee on wobbily feet, at least that's what I'm thinkin\nThat's when he tackled me stagnant and stinkin\nI said, \"No way occifer, I haven't been drinkin\"\nThen he said, \"You're under arrest kid, and we're goin back to the precinct\"\n\n[Hook]\n\"When I get bent, I must represent, no question\" {*scratched*}\nI'm the lush president of the wino section\nSince you find no lessons in this lonely life, it's like... \"Shorty let me\nTell you 'bout my only vice\" {*scratched*}\n\"When I get bent, I must represent, no question\" {*scratched*}\nI been at war with lady liks and can't find no weapons\nOr find protection in this lonely life, it's like... \"Shorty let me tell you\n'bout my only vice\" {*scratched*}\n\n"

Bush asking Saddam Hussein to be his Valentine\n\nDon't say peace in the East is a fleeting mirage\nI know Sweden be needing a Swedish massage\nI see Eden right here and I'm fiendin the cause\nby the evening I'm leaving to see that this heathen gets Ireland, England, and Whales to minage\nBasically George Porgie's pushing for a diplomatic orgy\n\nUganda, Botswana, Guyana, Peru\nNamibia, Libya, India too\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kirghiizistan, Kazakhstan tell 'em I'm comin' for you\nI'm gonna get all the tanning oil and give the world a sensual full body massage\nDislodging misogyny causing a total global collage and going rope-a-dope on folks who go for broke on breaking hope and groping fraud\nSo Cupid just quit his deskjob, Bob\nand this vigilante love god's marauding on uncharted ground\nthe standard rounds of applause lauded on liberally living the cause\nGiving the flaws a bit of the credit of breaking the laws and giving me migraines my pain is the refrain of a symphony of sympathy sweeping the planet\nDamnit I've got a blazing arrow and I'm not afraid to plant it right in your ass if you've got one ounce of anti-romantic Semitic semantics in you that you wanna pass off as true\nIf you're a threat to global harmony I'm comin' for you\nNot to hurt you just to show you what some lovin' can do\nThe age of fighting is through, we'll be as close as superglue\nIf you get off your ass and show some goddamn love to Cupid too\n\n"

This is Louis fucking Logic\nComing through your speakers and\nYour sound system with The Molemen\nYo, my man Panik laced the track for y'all\nYou better bounce like basketball\nWe on our own shit like cats and dogs\nSo check it out y'all, check it out y'all\nCheck it out, what?\n\n[Verse One]\nI always get the job cause I know what to do\nUnless the odds are good\nThey find out that I'm a jerk then I'm like \"Fuck you too!\"\nI'm a much improved Superman, plus a lover too\nWith the ability to snatch your silly slut from under you\nIt's such a wonderful life, being someone who writes\nOf things that go bump in the night and make you run for your life\nI like to hunt with a knife, capture and kill\nOne of the punks that you might find on the mic\nCause I slash rappers at will\nMy eyes act as a filter\nTo expose the pussy under your tough guy exterior\nAnd [?]\nI spill guts with precision of a taxidermist\nWho confessed to gun threats up in Catholic churches\nThat's why my wax is worshiped in the States and abroad\nMy place is secured for the world's most tasteless award\nCause the further I stray from the Lord\nThe more underground and hot\nBecause my sound will win Satan's applause\n\n[Hook]\nYou don't know a man who can get the job done\nBefore the cops come with bulletproof vests and shotguns\nYou don't know a man who can get the job done\nBefore a chicken's pop comes home with his five sons\nAnd you don't know a man who can get the job done\nAnd make the snot run from niggas noses when they sob, son\nAnd y'all don't know a man that's doper than me\nCause by comparison, all others are hopeless MC's\n\n[Verse Two]\nY'all should know that I was qualified\nTo swallow lies and piss truth serum\nCause if Blue hear 'em, talking shit, do spear 'em\nSo get too near 'em and get sent on your way\nThe Heavenly Gates when my pens on my page, I meant what I say\nCause I lecture like Lieutenant Frank Slade\nSo expect that I can bless the mic\nWhile juggling three pinless grenades\nI'm well versed in disproving theory on 'The Bell Curve'\nAs Logic L serves on committees that expel herbs\nNerds need not apply\nIt's one or two dudes that'll tell you he can run with Lou\nBut first he gotta lie\nSure it's somewhat true, I'll probably die\nBut until the vodka dries and the joints are through\nIt's probably not tonight\nMy shelf life's longer than a bottle of Amstel Light\nHeld inside a very tight cooler that was well iced\nI seldom write a verse that wouldn't melt a mic\nSo when my phrase sets the stage ablaze\nYou see a fire engine's welcome lights\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three]\nSo let's just say that I got the freshest resume\nCause I could catch a case in any place and then escape\nAnd get away riding Debo's bike\nDespite the fact that the type of stuff I write in raps\nPolice don't like\nAnd you could still catch a cop saying, \"He's so nice\"\nI'll never stop fighting back and I don't need no mic\nCause I might just snatch a bullhorn right out of a squad car\nAnd scream a rhyme so loud the sound waves scramble the OnStar\nIf any question remains, I use professional aim\nAnd target the section of brain that kept it aflame\nAnd test him again to see if he's a non-believer\nBut I bet that he's changed\nWhen my songs coming through his mom's receiver\nI'm a non-achiever, I don't have to try\nI can hold two mics like chopsticks and catch a fly\nSo ask me why I'm making rap records\nI'm liver than fuck\nWant to know why you don't\nAsk yourself, \"Why do I suck?\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

I see you dog\nWe used to sing in the [?] and shoot basketball\nNigga you was tall, damn you could shoot that ball\nMe, a played [?] so I always fouled\nWe had a crew that was rough from the smallest on up\nAnd when we had a little change we walked the [?] on us\nWe took the problems in the hood into our own hands\nFifteen in the park, whooping grown men\nBut I remember one time that we fought each other\nAnd I, fuck it lets call it a tie\n'Cause the girl was fighting over turned out to be freaky\nIn that regard we both winners although you deceased\nYour momma told me to stop [?}\nI lied and said I tried because her eyes reflect your coffin\nMan I don't want to see that, hope I'm forgiven\nCrosses and candle lights and yellow ribbons, you're gone too soon\n\n[Hook:]\nFamily and friends of the ones that's gone\nHold on be strong, we ain't in this alone\nLet not our heart be troubled take your burdens to the lord\nHe'll fight your battles, when times get hard\n[When the Chorus gets repeated the last four words are changed to \"Promised to God\"]\nX2\n\n[Verse Three: Willie D]\nMomma where have you gone, I'm still trying to a [?]\nLosing you made me strong, help me complete this song\nI'm so alone, dealing with the loss\nYou're still trying to come to grips the way you kicked me out your house\nMade me sit on the porch, in the cold\nI admit I was bad, but goddamn I was only five years old\nThat's too cold, made me made as shit\nOne of the reason I became a child advocate\nBut you know what they say, ain't nobody like Momma\nSince you, passed away ain't nobody like Momma\nYour breast cancer got worse with the Kimo\nIf you would have only taken a mammogram, who knows?\nAnd Pops even though we didn't have as much time spent\nI still felt it when you went\nI never got to bond with y'all, have fun with y'all\nMaybe somebody I'll become one with y'all, gone too soon\n\n[Hook:]\nFamily and friends of the ones that's gone\nHold on be strong, we ain't in this alone\nLet not our heart be troubled take your burdens to the lord\nHe'll fight your battles, when times get hard\n[When the Chorus gets repeated the last four words are changed to \"Promised to God\"]\nX2\n\n[Outro:]\nFor my folks, gone but not forgotten\nYoung lady I spoke of in the first verse [?]\nJoe, one of God's most beautiful creations\n(Laughs) Killed the rest, before you was a mess\nCousin Lary, [?} can't beat them\n[?] All my soldiers in the rap game, my extended family\nEazy-E, Buff Love, Pac, Big L, [?], Biggie, Pun\n(Whoo!) DJ Screw, Mafioso, Fat Pat, Beautiful Left Eye\nWhat a crazy one\nAnd lived to it, when you put it down you did your R&B thang\nYou put it down for Hip Hop\nNever ride out on my boys, one of the most talented dudes to ever pick up a microphone\nBig Mello, what it do?\nIt's a done deal baby, yeah!\n\n"

Was only here for a minute\nThe bitch looked back grinning.  I know when I\u2019m comprehending this shit\nAll the noise in the nebulizer was hard to listen\nBut when she went to pick me up, yep, I started pissing (Take that)\nBut ever since benevolence wasn\u2019t in the frame of my thought\nI became shorts who kept his moms in and out of the courts\nActually, man had bigger mans to fracture me\nFigured he creep, rock me to sleep, come and capture me\nBut naturally I caught on.  Thinking I\u2019m sneaking but, see, I thought wrong\nThey placed in juvie somewhere near Hawthorne\nWasn\u2019t my turn to burn.

    "lyrics": "\n\n[Part I: Dance with the Devil]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI once knew a nigga whose real name was William\nHis primary concern was makin' a million\nBein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen\nHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams\nA corrupted young mind at the age of 13\nNigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\nHer son's heart simultaneously grew colder\nHe started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects\nCheckin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects\nHe was fascinated by material objects\nBut he understood money never bought respect\nHe built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal\nBut got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal\nSo criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real\nYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equal\nI don't project my insecurities in other people\nHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\nSo he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\nA feeble-minded young man with infinite potential\nThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental\nCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\nDancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed\nBut he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed\n\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do\nTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\nStartin' fights over little shit up on the block\nStepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock\nWorkin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\nFulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\nTired of the block niggas treatin' him the same\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nBut when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love\nThey told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\nBut only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die\nStandin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\nSuggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\nSo now he had a choice between goin' back to his life\nOr makin' money with made men up in the cyph'\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\n\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'\nSmokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone\nThree in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nWalkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\n\"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw\"\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nScreamin', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!\"\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'\nBlood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\nRippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned\nWhen they were done and she was lyin'\nBloody, broken and bruised\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\n\n[Sample]\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\n\n[Verse 4]\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nAnd he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\n'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother\nShe looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nWorkin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nAnd cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared\nBut only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\nAnd listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true\n'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\nIn fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows\nAnd every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow\nHe could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nWhite, brown, yellow and black \u2014 color is not restricted\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted\nAnd you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never\nBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever\n\n[Part TII \"I\"]\n\n[Intro: Immortal Technique]\nOh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?\nWell, it\u2019s not, you didn\u2019t count on a fallen angel gettin' back\nInto the grace of God and comin' after you\nY\u2019all niggas ain\u2019t shit, your producers ain\u2019t shit\nYour fuckin' A & R ain\u2019t shit\nI\u2019ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal\nYo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker\u2019s head off!\n\n[Verse 1: Diabolic]\nGo \u2018head and grip Glocks\nI\u2019ll snap your trigger finger in six spots\nYou\u2019ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots\nI\u2019ll watch you topple flat\nPut away your rings and holla back\nCan\u2019t freestyle; you\u2019re screwed off the top, like bottle caps\nBeneath the surface\nI\u2019m overheatin' your receiving circuits\nBy unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches\nWhat you preach is worthless\nYour worship defeat the purpose\nLike President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service\nBeyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em\nShow no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm\nTour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend\u2019s dick\nIn the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist\nDiabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague\nFist-fuckin\u2019 a pussy\u2019s face, holdin' a hand grenade\nSo if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you\u2019re less than nothin'\nI just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nYou motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me\nI\u2019ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army\nStorm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I\u2019m on a mission\nTo split your body into a billion one-celled organisms\nImmortal Technique\u2019ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch\nYou\u2019re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix\nI\u2019m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips\nArsenic language transmitted revolutionarily\nI\u2019m like time itself: I\u2019m gonna kill you inevitably\nChemically bomb you, fuck usin\u2019 a chrome piece\nI\u2019m Illmatic, you won\u2019t make it home, like Jerome\u2019s niece\nI\u2019ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me\nAnd then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy\nThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology\nSo you\u2019re nothin', like diversity without equality\nAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology\nUsin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven\nProduces more digits than 22 divided by seven\nYou\u2019re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect\nYou never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet\nYour mind is empty and spacious\nLike the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist\nFace it, you\u2019re too basic, you\u2019re never gonna make it\nLike children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked\n\n"

    "lyrics": "\n\nTo think about the origins of Hip-Hop in this culture and also about Homeland Security is to see that there are, at the very least, two worlds in America: one of the well-to-do and another of the struggling. For if ever there was the absence of Homeland Security, it is seen in the gritty roots of Hip-Hop. For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty. In the broader society, the opposite is true, for here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so wide spread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. They're very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence, or the U.S Department of Justice. They're just words, they have very little relationship to reality. Now do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon? Do you think duct tape and Kleenex and color codes will make you safer? From Death Row this is Mumia Abu-Jamal\n\n"

Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag\nTry to confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:\nCapitalism and democracy are not synonymous\nYou swallow propaganda like a birth control pill\nSellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill\nBut that will never be me 'cause I'm leavin' the past\nLike an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass\nLike a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash\nUnbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash\nI'm out with the black box and I refuse to return\nI spit reality instead of what you usually learn\nAnd I refuse to be concerned with condescendin' advice\n'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that could change my life\n\n[Outro]\nSome people think I won't make it, but I know that I will\nEscape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills\nThe flow and the skill, I made y'all believe that it last\nYou can make the future, but it starts with leavin' the past\n\n"

The first line out, so\nHere we are eight years strong and still movin'\nGroovin with a reputation ya can't ruin\nI wanna take it back how it used to be\nFive thousand fucked up, rockin outta unity\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nWas it the alcohol in you, the money the power the fame\nThat made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my name?\nPlayed those games nigga when I was younger in life\n'Til I seen another man's life cut short with a knife\nLose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us\nYa can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us\nWhen times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic\nNever been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard\nBut I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor\nI never been a actor, I'm nothin but a monster\nI move in silence, speak with violence\nThink with science, live free and walk with lions\nCats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat\nIt takes a nation of millions to hold me back\nPounds of cush to push what I'm talkin about\nIt's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth\nIt's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out\nDon't let the things that you can't change stress you out\nCause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a son\nAnd change the world with the power of one c'mon\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

Why do I still write?\nSometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life\nSometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics\nAnd show these people what my level of skill's like\nBut I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life\nSomethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights\nCase of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like\nDa-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault\nGreat big eyeballs, my insides crawl\nAnd I clam up [wham],\u200b I just slam shut\nI just can't do it, my whole manhood's\nJust been stripped, I have just been vicked\nSo I must then get off the bus, then split\nMan, fuck this shit, yo I'm goin' the fuck home\nWorld on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, I'ma make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back\nThe spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap\nTo the same plant, in the same pants\nTryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP\nAnd get a new plan, Momma's got a new man\nPoor little baby sister, she don't understand\nSits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad\nAnd just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand\nWhile she colors her big brother and mother and dad\nAin't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head\nWish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had\nBut I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad\nSometimes I get upset, \u2018cause I ain't blew up yet\nIt's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet\nDon't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep\nThe pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best\nAnd I try, sit alone and I cry\nYo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by\nThat I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God\nPlease don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job\nYo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are\nYo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow\nTell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye\nSay whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far\nBut yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know\nAnd I'ma be back for you the second that I blow\nOn everything I own, I'll make it on my own\nOff to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it\nOr see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is\nTo be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits\nIt's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate\nOf authenticity, you'd never even see\nBut it's everything to me, it's my credibility\nYou never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC\nWho's incredible upon the same pedestal as me\nBut yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time\nSit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes\nGo to work and serve MC's in the lunchline\nBut when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?\nWho must I show to bust my flow?\nWhere must I go? Who must I know?\nOr am I just another crab in the bucket?\n\u2018Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it\nMaybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit\nI'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with\nI look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit\nAt the Salvation Army tryin' to salvage an outfit\nAnd it's cold, tryna travel this road\nPlus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode\nMy defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one, this city is no fun\nThere is no sun, and it's so dark\nSometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart\nFrom each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends\nIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin\nSometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not\nWhat I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top\nI just explode, the kettle gets so hot\nSometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got\nBut I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn\nYo, it only takes one time for me to get burned\nAin't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl\nI can no longer play stupid or be immature\nI got every ingredient, all I need is the courage\nLike I already got the beat, all I need is the words\nGot the urge, suddenly it's a surge\nSuddenly a new burst of energy has occurred\nTime to show these Free World leaders the 3 and a third\nI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird\nThen I turn and cross over the median curb\nHit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road\n\n"

VS, nothing less than the best\nSo I guess, that means I got expensive breath\nBut I'm more than just jewelry, I'm more than just ice\nBut me looking like a scrub, just wouldn't safice\nI got rolls gold glowing, lap tops showing\nBremie Louis the Thirteenth, to keep it flowing\nI can keep going and going, but what's the use\nYou know I'm balling in the mix, cause I got the juice\nI run with wise guys, so it's no surprise\nEverywhere I go, women undress me with they eyes\nBoys can't knock it, I'm on the rise like a rocket\nBig bank take lil' bank, I let you pick which pocket\nMy wrist glowing, like I stuck my hand in a socket\nIt's Paul Wall can't nobody stop it, break bread\n\n[Hook - 2x]\n\n[Lew Hawk]\nI'm a star stunning nigga, when I step in the club\nChannel sets cross my wrist, just like a light bulb\nGot Gucci cross my feet, while I shock and rock\nPopping Crystal bottles, will make these hoes bop\nWe some top notch playas, ain't no time for acting\nWe need ATM machines, for the loot we stacking\nBetter think shoot a fee, I bet it won't break me\nPlus I spend a few G's, up in VIP\nIt's the currency, that make these hoochies hunch\nAll they want is a hour fifty, take em out to lunch\nBut they must be drunk, I never trick off ends\nJust flip a blue Benz, with the blue eyes lens\nOn 16 headed North, with my chrome girlfriend\nShe could make your life end, and not get sent to the Penn\nThis for my niggas in the Penn, that won't see sunshine\nGot princess cuts in my mouth, you could see sunshine, break bread\n\n[Hook - 2x]\n\n[Gu-U]\nJumping in the slab, I'm bound to turn heads\nIn something's blue red, running lights like the FED's\nMan I feel like Pac, it's all eyes on me\nSitting on 23's, in the black SUV\nA life of luxury, that's the life for me\nYou can catch me at the mall, spending 15 thee\nOn the piece and chain, got rocks and rings\nHoes attitudes changed, since I'm having thangs\nIt's hard to explain, but that's the way it goes\nOver night I went from showing rocks, to rocking shows\nHoes that wouldn't speak, now they watching me\nBut I'm trying to figure out, is it the watch or me\nOr the foreign car, with the blue eyed lens\nIt's a bird it's a plane, that's my made back Benz\nIs we cutting or what, is what I'm asking her\nIn Texas she saw my chain, it's a massacre, break bread\n\n[Hook - 2x]\n\n"

Just spark it\nIf twenty-six's ain't on your truck, you should just park it\nBecause you're out there like that department store, Target\nI bought the Beatles catalog back from Michael Jackson\nThen called his ass a child-molester right before I slapped him\nThen sold the shit to Paul McCartney, then I double-taxed him\nThe chrome Desert Eagle convinced him - and relaxed him\nChristina Aguilara came over, did me dirty\nI told Beyonce stop trying to give me Jay z's birdy\nI know you purdy, but go get me an ice-cold Pepsi\nThen get your ass in this hot tub with me and Lisa Marie Presley\nHook:\nBoss up\nDon't get me crossed up\nWe like to drink the sauce up\nToss money at the bar and floss up\nBoss up\nY'all know who's the nicest\nI'm from Detroit, player\nI don't care what the price is\n\nVerse 2:\nI walk on rose petals, my feet never touch the ground\nGot two bitches - one to wipe me up, one to wipe me down\nI sleep with three women all night, it's like a hardcore porn\nThey got me shaking in my bed like Ozzy Osbourne\nI got the power\nI'm pissing golden showers\nThe ho that wipe my ass say it smells like flowers\nIs that necessary? Me and Hallie Barry in a bubble bath\nJust got back from Germany, I'm jet lag\n\nHook:\nBoss up\nDon't get me crossed up\nWe like to drink the sauce up\nToss money at the bar and floss up\nBoss up\nY'all know who's the nicest\nI'm from Detroit, player\nI don't care what the price is\n\nVerce 3:\nI got four hundred acres in the city on the East side\nPolice, they work for me, deliver donuts and pizza\nI pay Mariah Carey to come and sit on my toilet and sing to me\nWhen I'm in the tub, and dry my booty when I'm done\nI got three helicopters and I rent them out for videos\nSo rappers can front and try to boss up like me, I suppose\nI got a pit with platinum slugs and a doghouse, with an escalator in it\nYou's a hater, admit it\nI did it, I made it\nYou hate it, can't fade it\nMurdered a bitch with my bare hands and only got a fine and paid it\nBought the jury each a bently, after the trial I took it back\nHere I come! Look at that! Where my fucking hookers at?\nHad a private jet, but I sold it to the Soviets\nAs boss as it gets, for real and flossing all hits\nI'm underground, undetected, much respected\nNever rejected, my downfall - don't expect it\n\nHook:\nBoss up\nDon't get me crossed up\nWe like to drink the sauce up\nToss money at the bar and floss up\nBoss up\nY'all know who's the nicest\nI'm from Detroit, player\nI don't care what the price is\n\n"

You're mad cause I don't want to talk?\nBut you'd be even more pissed off if I told you what I really thought\nSo just walk away (just walk away)\nYou're better off never caring what I say (never caring what I say)\n\n[Hook: Eyedea]\nI've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces\nI don't miss none of them and they don't miss me\nFell in love with sensation\nNow I'm my own mental patient\nBut that's the price you pay if you want to live free\nKill my dedication\nPut me on your medication\nDrop me off in space and never come to get me\nNothing that I say has ever been that amazing\nSo when I die do me a favor and forget me (forget me.. x7)\n\n[Verse 2: Slug]\nWell\nSomething in the air make me not want to care\nLet 'em stare till I'm riding on an empty spare\nFollow the vein straight\nAs it drapes across the landscape and the sand and the lake\nOff the beaten path\nLearn the secret math\nKeeping the laugh, smug\nToo deep in the back of luck\nHappy as fuck\nBut nobody's convinced\nPlay daddy to the love and try to drop a couple hints\nEver since I first came to learn all the right turns\nI was cursed with the cigarette burns and the lost words\nFound inspiration inside your misery\nAlways trying to take an inch\nMore than what they're giving me\nDear God\nLet me die on the rich people's lawns\nBecause I'm not so sure they're gonna learn my songs\nEvery morning he repeats that same shit\nSpends the day dying to be famous\nWell another day, shot\nAnd I'm thinking this aquarium is deeper than the last one\nMy castle was never made of sand\nIt's one big aluminum can\nThe chateau of the damned\nThe shadow of the man you pretend you are\nHad a rough thought that got caught and went too far\nAnd if I did have a car I'd go broke from the gas\nOn the shoulder of the road\nWhile you roll past\n\n[Hook: Eyedea]\nI've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces\nI don't miss none of them and they don't miss me\nFell in love with sensation\nNow I'm my own mental patient\nBut that's the price you pay if you want to live free\nKill my dedication\nPut me on your medication\nDrop me off in space and never come to get me\nNothing that I say has ever been that amazing\nSo when I die do me a favor and forget me (forget me.. x7)\n\n[Outro]\n\n"

Let go of you\nI mean, think about it, what have you done for you lately?\nI\u2019m having trouble following your philosophy\nYou have to jump in. Jump in by those scopes?\nNo, in the water. In the River?\nYes, Jump in the River, Jump in the River\u2026\n\nWe're all born into this river without knowing how to swim\nAnd eventually we learn how to keep the water under our chins\nSome times this river is so cold to be in\nFreezing my soul, solidifying my skin\nRegardless of how far I see, I never see my travels end\nWe're carried by the current, being driven by the wind\nThe scenery we pass, we'll never see again\nSo we store it up as memories and don't let go of them\nWere under a spell thinking the river should go straight\nWe set goals and desires to control our own fate\nBut all the pain we experience is a result of our expectations\nBecause it's the rivers nature to twist and turn\nThe shit can burn\nAnd I know it\nI have the same conflict\nBut I try to sit and flow with this rivers natural process\nAnd sometimes when I watch myself float downstream\nI see the beauty of it all, and it feels like a dream\nAnd at that time I appreciate the rivers course\nSome call it God, reality, momentum, force\nI stare up at the naked moon, and she stares down at me\nOutside false boundaries I\u2019m all I look outward to see\nThe universe is not something separate from yourself\nI know you feel alone, but that's why I'm here to help\nI know you feel alone, but just look up at the stars\nAnd everything that is out there is what you really are\n\nWe gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life\nEveryone has different pasts and we're seeking the light\nThe world is divided between peasants and kings\nBut the truth is everyone is looking for the same thing\nNow I want you to know\nThe role you play is part of the whole\nWithout you it couldn't be, and I mean that with compassion\nSo if you need anything, I mean anything at all\nI'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man\nI'm here for you, in the same way that you're here for me\nEach person in an intricate piece of infinity\nI feel that if you could see what I see\nThen we as humanity could be free\nI'm here for you, not for any self centered reasons\nBecause existence is interdependent and all's related\nConnected in its different manifestations of one single mind\nYou ain't isolated from the world even though it feels like that sometimes\n\nI see the hurt when I look into your eyes\nHow you struggle to hold it and keep in bundled inside\nIt drives a dull blade deep in my heart; it makes me want to cry\nSo I offer you a hand to help wash away the rainy skies\nI'm running out of words, but I haven't yet made my message clear\nSo if none of this makes sense, I just want you to know I'm here\nAs a musician, as a friend, as a teacher, as a student\nTo grow and realize that everything's in constant movement\nEach problem that we face is just a part of this movement\nIt seems helpless, but if we stick together we'll get through it\nAnd return to the essence from which we've been uprooted\nAnd wake humanity from these illusions\nThe second you can look into the sky and see your own reflection\nYou know your head is in the right direction\nThe river riding always moves, but with it I live\nAnd everything is perfect, just the way it is\n\nWe gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life\nEveryone has different pasts and we're seeking the light\nThe world is divided between peasants and kings\nBut the truth is everyone is looking for the same thing\nNow I want you to know\nThe role you play is part of the whole\nWithout you it couldn't be, and I mean that with compassion\nSo if you need anything, I mean anything at all\nI'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man\nI'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man\nI'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man\n\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\nEverything's cool as I float downstream\n\n"

I've watched your offers, caught your calls and\nCalled your forefathers my bosses, lost it all in the name of gaining enough\nTo spend, consuming the youth since those pray in doom for the hand my friends, see\nWhen I saw my man playing away on his drum\nSomething clicked in my brain and I became less numb\nI'm working for bread crumbs\nPretending there's a meaning\nBut my employment is just a bucket, I'm desperately beating\nAnd one day, I'll be old and retired\nLooking at my life like what a waste of good fire\nAll because school never taught me how to be inspired\nAnd the job concerned applying to myself just wouldn't hire\n\nMake Money and die that's the American Way\nMake Money and die that's the American Way\nMake Money and die that's the American Way\nIt don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play\nMake Money and die that's the American Way\nMake Money and die that's the American Way\nMake Money and die that's the American Way\nBut hey, here's my application, how much do y'all pay\n\n"

Damn...\n\n[X2]\nThe curiosity that killed Schr\u00f6dinger's cat was the only thing that\nKept it alive matter of fact\nWhen life takes your life away how do you get it back?\nLike that... like that...\n\n"

I\u2019m the one who makes it. I know how good it is. When y\u2019all go to the studio, you make shit! I make the gourmet quality stuff because when I listen to it, I like to hear it. But you know what\u2019s on my mind right now?\n\nWhat?\n\n(Random Guy)\nYo, I\u2019m sick of all you stupid motherfuckers talking shit about my man, Eyedea. Matter of fact, if I catch you saying any stupid shit like that around me, I'mma punch a motherfucking hole in your head! Talkin' bout \"Eyedea this, Eyedea that\"- get off his dick! And to all y\u2019all critics talkin\u2019 shit, you can eat a dick too, you punk bitches\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou got balls stepping up with what you saying to me\nI\u2019m probably your favorite MC\u2019s favorite MC\nSo let these lyrics infuriate your head's interior\nThreaded by inferiority complex\nDelirium content, please hear when my mouth sets\nTo tear you into shreds and put your arrogance in its deathbed your best bet's to quit laughing\nUnless you\u2019re good at dodging bullets\nAin\u2019t shit gonna happen\nTill you shut your trap and learn to focus\nOpen that overgrown head for a change\nAnd don\u2019t underestimate me in a battle I don\u2019t play\nI rip every kid in your clique in five, less than four bars\nI\u2019ll take this out to east and west\nDon\u2019t test the north star!\nOh are you pissed \u2018cause your talent ain\u2019t felt?\nWell, this talkin\u2019 shit\u2019s easy, I challenge myself\nIf you were really dope, you wouldn\u2019t say it all the time\nYou would be creative and I\u2019d see it in your rhymes\nYou got the nerve to say I\u2019m soft\nCause the thoughts that I talk\nBut I think that you\u2019re lost, why don\u2019t you go take a walk?\nAnd find someone who cares how tight you think your style is\nNow quit being childish!\nShake my hand and smile bitch!\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat gave you the right to have an ego?\nYou got no skills! It\u2019s obvious an MC\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to be\nWell if it gets out of hand, my man, just remember\nI\u2019ll always be around to remind you you\u2019re weak!\nRhymesayers Entertainment, you know we be the greatest\nWith the break and the paints, the cuts, the rhymes and the beats!\nHomebase is Minneap, come on through!\nAnd bring your crew\nNext time you need to be reminded you\u2019re weak!\n\n(Bridge)\nAyo, look at that Eyedea kid\nI don\u2019t even know, man\nYo, that shit he did on the Blaze Battle was kinda tight!\nYeah, no doubt, but his album\u2019s kind of weird!\nI know man, he ain\u2019t never gonna get a record deal sounding like that!\nTrue that...\n\n[Verse 2]\nCheck me out now!\nI\u2019m that kid, who never gave a fuck about a contract\nIf you need to make a buck, get loose\nRock the mic, but don\u2019t be dumb and come and test me\nKids be jocking like the get-paid bus, swinging from my testes\nInch-by-inch I grow less convinced by those quote un-quote\nBattle rappers that think they\u2019re in the triple-leagues\nEasily I took their title and I never gave it back\nHow come my weakest freestyle probably beats they best-written rap?\nThey doubt it, and then they call me out about it\nAnd I flew off in these topics, I win, and the crowd shouted\nAnd you can say the same but you kid\nBeat, lines are skin-deep simply when you wimps become turned into mince meat\nBut being fresh is only half of the job\nThere\u2019s a lot in this world that needs to be changed\nAnd so I write each song with a message for humanity\nAnd it expresses the wisdom expressed that\u2019s in my brain\nComplaining? No. Just draining pus before the cyst pops\nBoy, you player hate, I\u2019m tryna elevate this hip hop!\nSo stop trying to pretend you\u2019re real\nAnd go write a song someone besides your friends can feel! For real!\n\nSometimes you just gotta let \u2018em know!\nMost of these MCs don\u2019t even deserve\nTo be on a dick like they do\nAnd that\u2019s the truth\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat gave you the right to have an ego?\nYou got no skills!

(x2)\n\n[Hook - x2]\n\n[Verse 2]\nLate in the afternoon the mailman was delivering\nSo I threw him in my house, slit his throat and left him shivering\nJust because my social security check came too late\nAnd I wasn't gonna make it to the bank, so he had to meet his death date\nOne day I'm kicking it with the homies and the neighbors got mad at us\nSo I threw him in my basement to kick it with my baby snakes and rattlers\nThey should not have told that me that the ATF was gon' rage\nJust because we in the backyard blowing up dynamite sticks and grenades\nI called the Domino's pizza man while watching a football game\nAnd it made mad after he didn't show up when thirty minutes came\nSo when the doorbell rang I fucked him up like a mobster\nWhile my baby mama still complaining that she got fingers up in her pasta\nI went to the speaker shop to get 18s for my truck\nBut when I got in my ride I didn't like the way that they hooked 'em up (uh)\nBecause the amp would turn off whenever it wasn't cold\nHe got in my truck to fix it, I turned up the beat and watched his ears explode\nSo call the coroner 'cuz Lucky Lurch just warming up\nDead bodies and still decapitating niggas with maggots swarming 'em (uh)\n'Cuz murder's a hobby, I'm using a torture chamber and not a Ruger\nSo if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga I did it to you\n\n[Hook - x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll make you play tug of war with barb wire\nThen pour salt on your wounds and gas on your clothes and start a fire\nLet it burn for two minutes and put it out\nTake the pus out your wounds and put that shit up in your mouth\nI don't give a fuck about my enemies nigga, I done lost it\nI'll stick your hands in a freezer until them mothafuckas is frosted\nAnd then I'll turn on the heater and watch 'em thaw\nWhile you agonizing in pain, I'll simply break yo jaw\nSo call the coroner 'cuz Lucky Lurch just warming up\nDead bodies and still decapitating niggas with maggots swarming 'em\n'Cuz murder's a hobby, I'm using a torture chamber and not a Ruger\nSo if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga, I did it you\n\n[Pause]\n\n[Outro]\nMurder, kill kill kill kill, murder murder murder murder, kill kill kill\n'Cuz murder's a hobby I'm using a torture chamber and not a Ruger\nSo if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga, I did it to you\n\n[Hook]\n\n"

    "lyrics": "\n\nI've taught you for three years instructing you in my Poison Clan techniques. We live here in seclusion so we can talk about the clan. The point is I had pupils once. Is that a fact? What are there names? Where are they? I don't know their names now. When they left they all took new names, as the whole idea was to keep their identities a close secret. So even they don't know each other's names. And while they were here they always wore masks to avoid being known. I worry about what there all doing. What I taught them could be used wrongly for evil to hurt men. So then I would like to make sure this hasn't been the case and you will do that for me. Teacher, how will I find them if they've changed their names? And to make it harder they won't show their skills they'll keep them hidden unless it is an emergency. If bad you must kill them\n\n"

Rios, C. Rios, V. Rios, Veronica]\nThere's something I want to tell you (I want to tell you)\nThere's something I think your crew should know\nBig Pun is the largest (so large) we straight out of the projects\nThat's how we roll.. (that's how we roll..)\n\n[Big Pun]\nI keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat\nWhat you broke motherfuckers know about that?\nLookin fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli\nSparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli\nOn the celly blown Benz, chrome rims\nShinin like the stone gems on my gold rings\nI got it sewn Twinz, I can't begin to tell you the story\nThat soared me from livin poorly to a modern day Cinderfella\nI've been a killer and a drug dealer, a bugged nigga\nBut now I'm like Puffy cause money's thicker than blood player\nI'm still a threat but now I think before I flip\nCall my connects together\nAnd figure which cleaner's the best for the hit\nI get the job done, Pun's handlin business\nCandlelight dinners, havin a toast with the most glamorous bitches\nMy road to riches was no Christmas\nNow we blessed with gold Lazaruses\nSo expensive my whole family's religious\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Big Pun]\nAiyyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial\nLong as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle\nI'm tryin to triple a million and split it three ways\nJoe the God, Full Eclipse, and myself - that'll be the day\nI need a way to get it already got the ambition\nStart the ignition, watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition\nI'm on a mission which requires a higher position\nDesire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin\nI'm infinite like math, so I'm gonna last\nBut you wanna laugh all day, bullshit and sittin on your ass\nI'm all about cash and the power\nA stash with the power that lasts like hittin ass for an hour\nLet's get it locked, I want a watch with baguetted rocks\nSo I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops\nForget the cops, we got Deserts and Glocks too\nReady to rock whoever tryin to stop our cheddar from stockin forever\n\n[Hook] - 2X (*with variations*)\n\n[Big Pun]\nStraight out the PJ's Twinz, Soundview!\nCastle Hill, can't forget Bronx River\nLil Villes.. huh, the Forest Projects, Eden Wald\nBronxdale, the Bronx baby straight out the PJ's\nThat's where we from\n\n"

She thought she'd live with no arm\nThat's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight\nThey moved her room to room-she could tell by the light\nHandcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit\nPut guns to her head, every word she got hit\n\"Who shot the trooper?\" they asked her\nPut mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her\nHer mind raced till things got still\nOpened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed\nShe got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next\nHurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex\nThey lied and denied visits from her lawyer\nBut she was building as they tried to destroy her\nIf it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse\nI read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse\nI wonder what would happen if that would've been me?\nAll of this just so we could be free\nSo dig it, y'all\n\n[Chorus: Cee-Lo]\nI'm thinking of Assata, yes\nListen to my love, Assata, yes\nYour power and pride is beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nIt seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her\nWalkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her\nThough she kind of knew\nWhat made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue\nArrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning\nUneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in\nA cell, one cot, no window, facing hell\nPut in the basement of a prison with all males\nAnd the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes\nShe'd exercise, paint, and begin to read\nTwo years in a hole, her soul grew weak\nAway from people so long she forgot how to speak\nShe discovered freedom is a unspoken sound\nAnd a wall is a wall and can be broken down\nFound peace in the Panthers she went on trial with\nOne of the brothers she had a child with\nThe foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed\nHeld tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed\nIn need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed\nOut of this situation a girl was conceived\nSeparated from her, left to mother the Revolution\nAnd lactated to attack hate\nCause federal and state was built for a Black fate\nHer emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates\nThey fabricated cases, hoping one would stick\nAnd said she robbed places that didn't exist\nIn the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites\nThrough dark halls of hate she carried the light\nI wonder what would happen if that would've been me\nAll of this just so we could be free\nYeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me\nAll of this just so we could be free\nSo dig it, people\n\n[Chorus: Cee-Lo]\nI'm thinking of Assata, yes\nListen to my love, Assata, yes\nYour power and pride is beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nYo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring\nNews that she had had a dream\nHer dreams always meant what they needed them to mean\nWhat made them real was the action in between\nShe dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens\nThe fact that they always came true was the thing\nAssata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't of done\nMedical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun\nIt's time for her to see the sun from the other side\nTime for her daughter to be by her mother's side\nTime for this beautiful woman to become soft again\nTime for her to breathe, and not be told how or when\nShe untangled the chains and escaped the pain\nHow she broke out of prison I could never explain\nAnd even to this day they try to get to her\nBut she's free with political asylum in Cuba\n\n[Chorus: Cee-Lo]\nI\u2019m thinking of Assata, yeah\nListen to my love, Assata, yeah\nWe\u2019re molded from the same mud, Assata\nWe share the same blood, Assata, yeah\nYour power and pride, so beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\nYour power and pride, so beautiful\nMay God bless your soul\n\n[Outro: Assata Shakur]\nFreedom? You're asking me about freedom? You're asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, because I've never been free. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is\n\nThe way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to\nBlossom. Freedom is-- is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do--\n\n"

Me first, um, it was like, you know, there was a period of time where I was just out, you know, just, just gone from the public, and, uh, I came to terms with the fact that... I had created this, uh, public persona, this public illusion.\n\nAnd it became, it, uh, it helped me hostage; like I couldn't be a real person because you're too afraid of, you know, what your, your public will say.\n\nAnd at that point I had to do some dying and really accept the fact that, look, \"this is who I am, and I have to be who I am, and all of us have a right to be who we are, and whenever we submit our will, because our will is a gift, it is given to us, so whenever we submit our will to someone else's opinion, you know, I mean, a part of us dies.\"\n\nYou know, and so it's been, um... it's been, it actually hasn't been a long time. It feels like a long time, but it hasn't been a long time. Some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time, and uh, I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.\n\nI know some of it sounds almost cryptic and I been really just, just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where I'm coming from as simply as possible, so I'm working on that.\n\nBut um... you know, I know, that you know that there's, uh... you know that I know that God doesn't lie and I know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else, so I don't worry about that, cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening, that's what supposed to be understood at that time, so it's all good.\n\nBut, um, this is a song called \"Oh Jerusalem\".\n\n"

Y\u2019all givin\u2019 me a clap.\nA yes is fine (laughing) ok?\n(voice from audience \u201cI love that song\u201d)\nThank you. Praise God.\n\nI tell you, I know everybody\u2019s in the same mess. I\u2019m telling you.\nWe all are.\nI, I, I know that, you know...\nand I\u2019m just, you know, I\u2019ll be the first to tell you, you know,\nI\u2019m a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I\u2019m trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. Cuz you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You\u2019re the problem, ok, I\u2019m going to show you how you\u2019re causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that\u2019s what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind.\n\nIt\u2019s like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that\u2019s deception, you know.\nThe real gospel is Repent, which means \u2018let go of all that crap,\u2019 that\u2019s killin\u2019 you.\nLife was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know.\nAnd when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust.\nIt wasn\u2019t about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can\u2019t do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you\u2019re supporting and carryin\u2019 and you know, it\u2019s not good. You know, everybody\u2026\na friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it\u2019s own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is.\nSee , that\u2019s what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can\u2019t wait to see the game, you know. It\u2019s doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know.\nThat\u2019s how we\u2019re thankful. That\u2019s how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive.\n\nAnd I\u2019m just glad that I, you know, I don\u2019t have to slave anymore. You know, cuz I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate?\nAnd so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn\u2019t reality. It wasn\u2019t the standard at all, you know. T\nhere\u2019s a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says \u2018We compare ourselves amongst ourselves\u2019 you know. That\u2019s not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we\u2019re trying to fit into a standard? It doesn\u2019t make any sense, you know.\n\nSo now I\u2019m just, you know, after all that, I\u2019m just ready to be me. And it\u2019s a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t understand, you know, because there\u2019s all this social doctrine that says, you know, that\nThe infinite God, with all this expression,\nwho created every single one of us,\nabsolutely different,\nOn purpose,\nwants everybody to fit into the same suit.\nBut like, you know, that\u2019s deception.\nThat\u2019s deception.\n\n(Talking to someone offstage) Ok, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don\u2019t think this is the right one.\n\nWe took\u2026we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disney world, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean.\nAnd I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion.\nAnd it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was.\n\nIt\u2019s like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin\u2019 their \u2018mm\u2019 workin all hard to make it look easy. What\u2019s the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh\u2026(audience laughs).\nYou know, it\u2019s like, you know what I\u2019m sayin?\nI mean, you know.\nSlaving.\nSlaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do.\nNone of us do.\nAnd reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let\u2019s stop frontin\u2019. And I\u2019m saying, you know, that\u2019s the blessing.\nNow we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?!\n\nAnd be free.\n\nAnd we want to defend the curse. I\u2019ll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time...\n\nToo long.\n(offstage) You didn\u2019t find it? It\u2019s another white one. But you see\u2026in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it\u2019s reality, ok (laughing)?\n\nOne time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely.\nYou know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me,\nhe said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else.\nI just want you to know that.\n\nBecause we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin\u2019 the face and you know, lookin hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is..it\u2019s like I\u2019ve always told to my husband, it\u2019s like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Ok, let\u2019s just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I\u2019m saying?\n\nYou can\u2019t get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out.\n\nYou know, and the way we\u2019ve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I\u2019m telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we\u2019ve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one.\n\nBoy I\u2019ll tell ya, God made him for me. I\u2019m something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I\u2019ll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y\u2019all could clap cuz that\u2019s some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I\u2019m sayin, ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he\u2019s like, Alright. So he\u2019s trying to do this but then I\u2019m like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I\u2019m like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Ok, I was like\u2026I\u2019m just not there anymore. Nah, I\u2019m telling you. It\u2019s like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he\u2019s learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he\u2019s like, Okay\u2026I\u2019m out. It\u2019s real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know.\n\nIt\u2019s like, we date people, like let\u2019s say, you know, we\u2019re interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I\u2019m sayin? It\u2019s like\u2026And that\u2019s why so many marriages end up in divorce. It\u2019s because people wake up next to a stranger.\nThey say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed?\nWhere\u2019s that man that used to do \u2018du, dua, and du.\u2019\nAnd I\u2019m sayin let\u2019s give them reality from the door because: you\u2019re going to attract love,\nand the one that really loves you. And then you don\u2019t have to pretend and falsify, and you know, keep that posture.\n\nYou know, you know, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m just like...I\u2019ll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it\u2019s not even that, you know. It\u2019s but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that\u2019s it, man, I mean, I\u2019m just telling you, it\u2019s so wonderful to finally find\u2026\n\nAnd trust me, it\u2019s a work in progress, it\u2019s not something that happens overnight.\nWe all have to be introduced to each other.\n\nI\u2019m telling you, I know that I\u2019m up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill.\nBut this is the first time y\u2019all meet me. You see what I\u2019m saying? Don\u2019t think you met me before, ok. And as I grow, you\u2019re going to meet me a little bit more. You\u2019re gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y\u2019all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I\u2019m just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that\u2019s not growin' is dead, so we better be changing.\n\nYou know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they\u2019d say, Uh, she\u2019s changing. The money\u2019s changing her. And I\u2019d say Listen, the money\u2019s not changing me, God\u2019s changing me. I\u2019m changing, because that\u2019s a natural part of life. We\u2019re all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man.\n\nAnd, um..there\u2019s gonna be warfare involved. Because there\u2019s some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don\u2019t like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I\u2019m a whole person. You can\u2019t say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I\u2019m a whole person. You know. And that\u2019s everybody.\n\nYou always talk about spiritual warfare and we didn\u2019t realize that it was in relationships. It\u2019s emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn\u2019t fit into our box for you, we say, well, I ain\u2019t in no box. Don\u2019t try to put me in one.\n\nI\u2019m going to play a little bit of guitar with this one, but I might stop it\u2019s cuz I really want you to listen to the words, so if I stop, you understand why. I want you to really hear the words\u2026\n\n"

M.I.C\n\n[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]\nI\u2019ve seen\nMillion-dollar niggas get murdered over G\u2019s\nNiggas pop shit.  Repercussion, cop pleas\nCock shit, Swiss skin cheese\nBelow degrees, planet freeze\nHeat the world, flame trees.  Fiends O-\n-D\u2019ing, production ain\u2019t stepped on.  Infrared\nBeam, slept on.

Many said I\nWould fail, never succeed\nAnd laughed as my palms bleed.  Tachyon dust\nLight speed, appetite of greed\nKilling each other over chickenfeed\nInsomnia, I\u2019m just tussling \u2018cause\nBrothers state-to-state still hustling, but I know\nThe darkness shed on the planet is necessary\nEqual balance, quantums are temporary\nChess, physics, convert astro\nA Cold War, MF Castro\nUnited Nations a bunch of assholes\nPeacekeepers overseas buck streetsweepers\nFBI dance with the Reaper\nCIA dance with the Reaper\nAlchemy turn air to water, New York\u2019s Atlantis\nAwkwardly stalk the ones hawking me.  Beyond\nTouch, beyond taste, beyond\nSight, everybody walk with me\nNuclei talk to the darkness, vibrate\nLight.  Friction, eyes dilate\nTime\u2019s manmade, so why wait?

Then fuck all y\u2019all\n\n[Verse 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]\nI paid for the sins of my ancestors, also for\nThe future sins of my predecessors.  I went on a quiet\nQuest to quiet down my aggressors, from multiple\nCorrectional facilities, understand utilities\nTurning liabilities to commodities.  So many tragic\nErrors in our era, this drama\u2019s a comedy, Devil\nContinuously consume my constructions, contaminating\nThe content through contagiousness.  My soul is\nOutraged, but I\u2019ll focus on continents.  Super-\n-star Jet Jaguar, Monsta Island Czar\nPeace\n\n[Outro: Sample from Godzilla vs. Megalon (1973)]\nGoro Ibuki: Isn\u2019t that Jet Jaguar there?\nRokuro \u201cRoku-chan\u201d Ibuki: Yes it is!
