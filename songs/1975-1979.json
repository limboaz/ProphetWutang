Hit it!\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon't you give me all that jive about things you wrote before I's alive\n'Cause this ain't 1823 -- ain't even 1970\nNow I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know\nSo every year just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme\n\nGonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good\nGonna rock shock clock it through your neighbourhood\nGonna read, gonna sing it till it's understood\nMy rappin' bout to happen like a knee you've been slapping\nOr a toe you've been tapping on a hunk of wood\n\nBout a red-suited dude with a friendly attitude\nAnd a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block\nGot a long white beard, maybe looks kind a weird\nAnd if you ever see him, he could give you quite a shock\n\nNow people let me tell ya bout last year\nWhen the dude came flying over here\nWell, the hog was out, snow's on the ground\nFolks stayed in to party down\nThe beat was thumping on the box, and I was dancing in my socks\nAnd the drummer played at a solid pace\nAnd a taste of the bass was in my face\nAnd the guitar player layed down a heavy layer\nOf the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat\nAnd the guy with the 88's started to participate\nAnd I could sure appreciate a sound so sweet\n\nWe were all in the mood so we had a little food\nAnd a joke, and a smoke, and a little bit of wine\nWhen I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof\nCould it be or was it me? I was feeling super fine\nSo I went to the attic where I thought heard the static\nOn the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in\nBut the noise on the top was a reindeer clop\nJust a trick St. Nick, and I let the sucker in\n\nHe was rolly, he was poly, and I said, \"Holy moly!\nYou got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin\"\nHe allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd\nOn the point of his jaw where the skin should've been\nGets cool for a fool going out every Yule\nFor a day on a sleigh when the cold went low\nSo the beard may be weird but I'll never have it sheared\nCause it's warm in the storm when it's ten below\n\nI said, \"You're right, it's cold tonight\nBut can you stop for a drop before you go?\"\nHe said, \"Why not if the music's hot?\nAnd I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe\"\nSo he went downstairs and forgot his cares\nAnd he rocked the spot and danced like a pro\nAnd every young girl tried to rock his world\nBut he boogie oogie oogied til he had to go\n\nAnd before he went, this fine old gent\nBrought a gift with a sift through his big red bags\nIn the top or the bottom, he reached in and got 'em\nToys for the boys, for the girls glad rags\nAnd the grownups got some presents too\nA new TV and a stereo\nA new Seville 'bout as blue as the sky\nThe best that money couldn't buy\n'Cause money could never ever buy the feeling\nThe one that comes from not concealing\nThe way you you feel about your friends\nAnd this is how the story ends\n\nThe dude in red's back at the Pole\nUp north where everything is cold\nBut if he were right here tonight\nHe'd say, Merry Christmas and to all a good night\n\n"
